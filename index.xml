[1:2] And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water, clear and pure to the taste, unlike anything else; so that, through the clearness thereof, one may look into the depths of the earth.</description>

[1:2] And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth,
[1:3] And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up.</description>

[1:3] So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.</description>

[1:3] &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Universe, I pray thee, that the merit of Aaron, the son of Amram, the lover of peace and pursuer of peace, who received the crown of priesthood from Thy Glory on the mount of Sinai, be valid for me in this hour, so that Qafsiel*, the prince, and the angels with him may not get power over me nor throw me down from the heavens &amp;ldquo;.</description>

      <description>Acts - World English Bible (WEB) [1:1] The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
[1:2] until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
[1:3] To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom.</description>

[1:3] For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.
[1:4] For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.</description>
