<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Issac’s sake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.</p>
<p><strong>[1:26]</strong> But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;</p>
<p><strong>[1:27]</strong> And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.</p>
<p><strong>[1:28]</strong> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[1:29]</strong> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:30]</strong> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:31]</strong> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:32]</strong> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:33]</strong> Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:34]</strong> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:35]</strong> O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord : praise and exalt him above all for ever,</p>
<p><strong>[1:36]</strong> O ye heavens, bless ye the Lord : praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>

<p><strong>[1:47]</strong> O ye nights and days, bless ye the Lord: bless and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:48]</strong> O ye light and darkness, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:49]</strong> O ye ice and cold, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:50]</strong> O ye frost and snow, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:51]</strong> O ye lightnings and clouds, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:52]</strong> O let the earth bless the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:53]</strong> O ye mountains and little hills, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:54]</strong> O all ye things that grow in the earth, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:55]</strong> O ye mountains, bless ye the Lord: Praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:56]</strong> O ye seas and rivers, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>

<p><strong>[1:63]</strong> O ye servants of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:64]</strong> O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:65]</strong> O ye holy and humble men of heart, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:66]</strong> O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever: far he hath delivered us from hell, and saved us from the hand of death, and delivered us out of the midst of the furnace and burning flame: even out of the midst of the fire hath he delivered us.</p>
<p><strong>[1:67]</strong> O give thanks unto the Lord, because he is gracious: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[1:68]</strong> O all ye that worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, praise him, and give him thanks: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
