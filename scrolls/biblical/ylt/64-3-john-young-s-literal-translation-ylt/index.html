<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> because for `His&rsquo; name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them &ndash; Diotrephes &ndash; doth not receive us;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God;</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also &ndash; we do testify, and ye have known that our testimony is true.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.</p>
