    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known the truth,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the beginning, that in it ye may walk,</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and the Son;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, `Hail!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> for he who is saying to him, `Hail,&rsquo; hath fellowship with his evil works.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.</p>
