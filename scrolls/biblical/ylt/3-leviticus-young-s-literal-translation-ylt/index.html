<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to Jehovah, out of the cattle &ndash; out of the herd, or out of the flock &ndash; ye do bring near your offering.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> <code>If his offering </code>is&rsquo; a burnt-offering out of the herd &ndash; a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure, before Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, and it hath been accepted for him to make atonement for him;</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near, and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which `is&rsquo; at the opening of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> `And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it into its pieces;</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar, and arranged wood on the fire;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces, with the head and the fat, on the wood, which <code>is' on the fire, which </code>is&rsquo; on the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> <code>And if his offering </code>is&rsquo; out of the flock &ndash; out of the sheep or out of the goats &ndash; for a burnt-offering, a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which <code>is' on the fire, which </code>is&rsquo; on the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume on the altar; it `is&rsquo; a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> <code>And if his offering </code>is&rsquo; a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar, and hath wrung off its head, and hath made perfume on the altar, and its blood hath been wrung out by the side of the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate <code>it'), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on the wood, which </code>is&rsquo; on the fire; it `is&rsquo; a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> `And when a person bringeth near an offering, a present to Jehovah, of flour is his offering, and he hath poured on it oil, and hath put on it frankincense;</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> and he hath brought it in unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he hath taken from thence the fulness of his hand of its flour and of its oil, besides all its frankincense, and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> and the remnant of the present `is&rsquo; for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> <code>And when thou bringest near an offering, a present baked in an oven, </code>it is of&rsquo; unleavened cakes of flour mixed with oil, or thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil.</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> <code>And if thine offering </code>is&rsquo; a present `made&rsquo; on the girdel, it is of flour, mixed with oil, unleavened;</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> divide thou it into parts, and thou hast poured on it oil; it `is&rsquo; a present.</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> <code>And if thine offering </code>is&rsquo; a present `made&rsquo; on the frying-pan, of flour with oil it is made,</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> and thou hast brought in the present which is made of these to Jehovah, and `one&rsquo; hath brought it near unto the priest, and he hath brought it nigh unto the altar,</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> and the priest hath lifted up from the present its memorial, and hath made perfume on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> and the remnant of the present `is&rsquo; for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> No present which ye bring near to Jehovah is made fermented, for with any leaven or any honey ye perfume no fire-offering to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> <code>An offering of first-</code>fruits&rsquo; &ndash; ye bring them near to Jehovah, but on the altar they go not up, for sweet fragrance.</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> And every offering &ndash; thy present &ndash; with salt thou dost season, and thou dost not let the salt of the covenant of thy God cease from thy present; with all thine offerings thou dost bring near salt.</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> <code>And if thou bring near a present of first-ripe </code>fruits&rsquo; to Jehovah, &ndash; of green ears, roasted with fire, beaten out <code>corn' of a fruitful field thou dost bring near the present of thy first-ripe </code>fruits&rsquo;,</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> and thou hast put on it oil, and laid on it frankincense, it `is&rsquo; a present;</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial from its beaten out `corn&rsquo;, and from its oil, besides all its frankincense &ndash; a fire-offering to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> <code>And if his offering </code>is&rsquo; a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near before Jehovah,</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> <code>And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which </code>is&rsquo; on the inwards,</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> and the two kidneys, and the fat which <code>is' on them, which </code>is&rsquo; on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> and sons of Aaron have made it a perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering which <code>is' on the wood, which </code>is&rsquo; on the fire &ndash; a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> <code>And if his offering </code>is&rsquo; out of the flock for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near;</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> if a sheep he is bringing near `for&rsquo; his offering, then he hath brought it near before Jehovah,</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> and hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> <code>And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah, its fat, the whole fat tail (over-against the bone he doth turn it aside), and the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which </code>is&rsquo; on the inwards,</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> and the two kidneys, and the fat which <code>is' on them, which </code>is&rsquo; on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar &ndash; bread of a fire-offering to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> <code>And if his offering </code>is&rsquo; a goat, then he hath brought it near before Jehovah,</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> and hath laid his hand on its head, and hath slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> and he hath brought near from it his offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which `is&rsquo; on the inwards,</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> and the two kidneys, and the fat which <code>is' upon them, which </code>is&rsquo; on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar &ndash; bread of a fire-offering, for sweet fragrance; all the fat `is&rsquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> `A statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings: any fat or any blood ye do not eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> <code>Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, When a person doth sin through ignorance against any of the commands of Jehovah </code>regarding things&rsquo; which are not to be done, and hath done `something&rsquo; against one of these &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> `If the priest who is anointed doth sin according to the guilt of the people, then he hath brought near for his sin which he hath sinned a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, to Jehovah, for a sin-offering,</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> and he hath brought in the bullock unto the opening of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, and hath laid his hand on the head of the bullock, and hath slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> `And the priest who is anointed hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and hath brought it in unto the tent of meeting,</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, and sprinkled of the blood seven times before Jehovah, at the front of the vail of the sanctuary;</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> and the priest hath put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-perfume before Jehovah, which <code>is' in the tent of meeting, and all the blood of the bullock he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which </code>is&rsquo; at the opening of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> <code>And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he doth lift up from it, the fat which is covering over the inwards, and all the fat which </code>is&rsquo; on the inwards,</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> and the two kidneys, and the fat which <code>is' on them, which </code>is&rsquo; on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar of the burnt-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> `And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, besides its head, and besides its legs, and its inwards, and its dung &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> he hath even brought out the whole bullock unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place, unto the place of the pouring out of the ashes, and he hath burnt it on the wood with fire; beside the place of the pouring out of the ashes it is burnt.</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> <code>And if the whole company of Israel err ignorantly, and the thing hath been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done </code>something against&rsquo; one of all the commands of Jehovah `concerning things&rsquo; which are not to be done, and have been guilty;</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> when the sin which they have sinned concerning it hath been known, then have the assembly brought near a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and they have brought it in before the tent of meeting;</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> and the elders of the company have laid their hands on the head of the bullock, before Jehovah, and `one&rsquo; hath slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> `And the priest who is anointed hath brought in of the blood of the bullock unto the tent of meeting,</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, and hath sprinkled seven times before Jehovah at the front of the vail,</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> and <code>some' of the blood he doth put on the horns of the altar which </code>is&rsquo; before Jehovah, which <code>is' in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which </code>is&rsquo; at the opening of the tent of meeting;</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> and all its fat he doth lift up from it, and hath made perfume on the altar.</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> `And he hath done to the bullock as he hath done to the bullock of the sin-offering, so he doth to it; and the priest hath made atonement for them, and it hath been forgiven them;</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> and he hath brought out the bullock unto the outside of the camp, and hath burned it as he hath burned the first bullock; it `is&rsquo; a sin-offering of the assembly.</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> <code>When a prince doth sin, and hath done </code>something against&rsquo; one of all the commands of Jehovah his God `regarding things&rsquo; which are not to be done, through ignorance, and hath been guilty &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[4:23]</strong> or his sin wherein he hath sinned hath been made known unto him, then he hath brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a male, a perfect one,</p>
<p><strong>[4:24]</strong> and he hath laid his hand on the head of the goat, and hath slaughtered it in the place where he doth slaughter the burnt-offering before Jehovah; it `is&rsquo; a sin-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:25]</strong> `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering,</p>
<p><strong>[4:26]</strong> and with all its fat he doth make perfume on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest hath made atonement for him because of his sin, and it hath been forgiven him.</p>
<p><strong>[4:27]</strong> <code>And if any person of the people of the land sin through ignorance, by his doing </code>something against&rsquo; one of the commands of Jehovah `regarding things&rsquo; which are not to be done, and hath been guilty &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[4:28]</strong> or his sin which he hath sinned hath been made known unto him, then he hath brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a perfect one, a female, for his sin which he hath sinned,</p>
<p><strong>[4:29]</strong> and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and hath slaughtered the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:30]</strong> `And the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar,</p>
<p><strong>[4:31]</strong> and all its fat he doth turn aside, as the fat hath been turned aside from off the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest hath made perfume on the altar, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah; and the priest hath made atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him.</p>
<p><strong>[4:32]</strong> <code>And if he bring in a sheep </code>for&rsquo; his offering, for a sin-offering, a female, a perfect one, he doth bring in,</p>
<p><strong>[4:33]</strong> and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and hath slaughtered it for a sin-offering in the place where he slaughtereth the burnt-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:34]</strong> `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he poureth out at the foundation of the altar,</p>
<p><strong>[4:35]</strong> and all its fat he turneth aside, as the fat of the sheep is turned aside from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and the priest hath made atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him.</p>
<p><strong>[5:1]</strong> <code>And when a person doth sin, and hath heard the voice of an oath, and he </code>is&rsquo; witness, or hath seen, or hath known &ndash; if he declare not, then he hath borne his iniquity:</p>
<p><strong>[5:2]</strong> `Or when a person cometh against any thing unclean, or against a carcase of an unclean beast, or against a carcase of unclean cattle, or against a carcase of an unclean teeming creature, and it hath been hidden from him, and he unclean, and guilty;</p>
<p><strong>[5:3]</strong> `Or when he cometh against uncleanness of man, even any of his uncleanness whereby he is unclean, and it hath been hidden from him, and he hath known, and hath been guilty:</p>
<p><strong>[5:4]</strong> `Or when a person sweareth, speaking wrongfully with the lips to do evil, or to do good, even anything which man speaketh wrongfully with an oath, and it hath been hid from him; &ndash; when he hath known then he hath been guilty of one of these;</p>
<p><strong>[5:5]</strong> `And it hath been when he is guilty of one of these, that he hath confessed concerning that which he hath sinned,</p>
<p><strong>[5:6]</strong> and hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female out of the flock, a lamb, or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for him, because of his sin.</p>
<p><strong>[5:7]</strong> `And if his hand reach not to the sufficiency of a lamb, then he hath brought in his guilt-offering &ndash; he who hath sinned &ndash; two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to Jehovah, one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering;</p>
<p><strong>[5:8]</strong> and he hath brought them in unto the priest, and hath brought near that which <code>is' for a sin-offering first, and hath wrung off its head from its neck, and doth not separate </code>it&rsquo;,</p>
<p><strong>[5:9]</strong> and he hath sprinkled of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar, and that which is left of the blood is wrung out at the foundation of the altar; it `is&rsquo; a sin-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[5:10]</strong> `And the second he maketh a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance, and the priest hath made atonement for him, because of his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him.</p>
<p><strong>[5:11]</strong> <code>And if his hand reach not to two turtle-doves, or to two young pigeons, then he hath brought in his offering -- he who hath sinned -- a tenth of an ephah of flour for a sin-offering; he putteth no oil on it, nor doth he put on it frankincense, for it </code>is&rsquo; a sin-offering,</p>
<p><strong>[5:12]</strong> and he hath brought it in unto the priest, and the priest hath taken a handful from it &ndash; the fulness of his hand &ndash; its memorial &ndash; and hath made perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Jehovah; it `is&rsquo; a sin-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[5:13]</strong> <code>And the priest hath made atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned against one of these, and it hath been forgiven him, and </code>the remnant&rsquo; hath been to the priest, like the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[5:14]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[5:15]</strong> <code>When a person committeth a trespass, and hath sinned through ignorance against the holy things of Jehovah, then he hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy valuation </code>in&rsquo; silver &ndash; shekels by the shekel of the sanctuary &ndash; for a guilt-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[5:16]</strong> `And that which he hath sinned against the holy thing he repayeth, and its fifth is adding to it, and hath given it to the priest, and the priest maketh atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and it hath been forgiven him.</p>
<p><strong>[5:17]</strong> <code>And when any person sinneth, and hath done </code>something against&rsquo; one of all the commands of Jehovah `regarding things&rsquo; which are not to be done, and hath not known, and he hath been guilty, and hath borne his iniquity,</p>
<p><strong>[5:18]</strong> `Then he hath brought in a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and the priest hath made atonement for him, for his ignorance in which he hath erred and he hath not known, and it hath been forgiven him;</p>
<p><strong>[5:19]</strong> it `is&rsquo; a guilt-offering; he hath been certainly guilty before Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[6:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[6:2]</strong> `When any person doth sin, and hath committed a trespass against Jehovah, and hath lied to his fellow concerning a deposit, or concerning fellowship, or concerning violent robbery, or hath oppressed his fellow;</p>
<p><strong>[6:3]</strong> or hath found a lost thing, and hath lied concerning it, and hath sworn to a falsehood, concerning one of all `these&rsquo; which man doth, sinning in them:</p>
<p><strong>[6:4]</strong> `Then it hath been, when he sinneth, and hath been guilty, that he hath returned the plunder which he hath taken violently away, or the thing which he hath got by oppression, or the deposit which hath been deposited with him, or the lost thing which he hath found;</p>
<p><strong>[6:5]</strong> or all that concerning which he sweareth falsely, he hath even repaid it in its principal, and its fifth he is adding to it; to him whose it `is&rsquo; he giveth it in the day of his guilt-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[6:6]</strong> `And his guilt-offering he bringeth in to Jehovah, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy estimation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest,</p>
<p><strong>[6:7]</strong> and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah, and it hath been forgiven him, concerning one thing of all that he doth, by being guilty therein.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[6:8]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[6:9]</strong> <code>Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This </code>is&rsquo; a law of the burnt-offering (it `is&rsquo; the burnt-offering, because of the burning on the altar all the night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar is burning on it,)</p>

<p><strong>[8:34]</strong> as he hath done on this day, Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you;</p>
<p><strong>[8:35]</strong> and at the opening of the tent of meeting ye abide, by day and by night seven days, and ye have kept the charge of Jehovah, and die not, for so I have been commanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[8:36]</strong> And Aaron doth &ndash; his sons also &ndash; all the things which Jehovah hath commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[9:1]</strong> And it cometh to pass on the eighth day, Moses hath called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[9:2]</strong> and he saith unto Aaron, `Take to thyself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[9:3]</strong> `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt-offering,</p>

<p><strong>[9:5]</strong> And they take that which Moses hath commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting, and all the company draw near and stand before Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[9:6]</strong> and Moses saith, <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the thing which Jehovah hath commanded; do `it&rsquo;, and the honour of Jehovah doth appear unto you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:7]</strong> And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Draw near unto the altar, and make thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah hath commanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:8]</strong> And Aaron draweth near unto the altar, and slaughtereth the calf of the sin-offering, which `is&rsquo; for himself;</p>
<p><strong>[9:9]</strong> and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him, and he dippeth his finger in the blood, and putteth `it&rsquo; on the horns of the altar, and the blood he hath poured out at the foundation of the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[9:10]</strong> and the fat, and the kidneys, and the redundance of the liver, of the sin-offering, he hath made a perfume on the altar, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses;</p>

<p><strong>[9:12]</strong> And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering, and the sons of Aaron have presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about;</p>
<p><strong>[9:13]</strong> and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him, by its pieces, and the head, and he maketh perfume on the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[9:14]</strong> and he washeth the inwards and the legs, and maketh perfume for the burnt-offering on the altar.</p>
<p><strong>[9:15]</strong> And he bringeth near the offering of the people, and taketh the goat of the sin-offering which `is&rsquo; for the people, and slaughtered it, and maketh it a sin-offering, like the first;</p>
<p><strong>[9:16]</strong> and he bringeth near the burnt-offering, and maketh it, according to the ordinance;</p>
<p><strong>[9:17]</strong> and he bringeth near the present, and filleth his palm with it, and maketh perfume on the altar, apart from the burnt-offering of the morning.</p>
<p><strong>[9:18]</strong> And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which `are&rsquo; for the people, and sons of Aaron present the blood unto him (and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about),</p>

<p><strong>[9:20]</strong> and they set the fat on the breasts, and he maketh perfume with the fat on the altar;</p>
<p><strong>[9:21]</strong> and the breasts, and the right leg hath Aaron waved &ndash; a wave-offering before Jehovah, as He hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[9:22]</strong> And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people, and blesseth them, and cometh down from making the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.</p>
<p><strong>[9:23]</strong> And Moses goeth in &ndash; Aaron also &ndash; unto the tent of meeting, and they come out, and bless the people, and the honour of Jehovah appeareth unto all the people;</p>
<p><strong>[9:24]</strong> and fire cometh out from before Jehovah, and consumeth on the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat; and all the people see, and cry aloud, and fall on their faces.</p>
<p><strong>[10:1]</strong> And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, take each his censer, and put in them fire, and put on it perfume, and bring near before Jehovah strange fire, which He hath not commanded them;</p>
<p><strong>[10:2]</strong> and fire goeth out from before Jehovah, and consumeth them, and they die before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[10:3]</strong> And Moses saith unto Aaron, <code>It </code>is&rsquo; that which Jehovah hath spoken, saying, By those drawing near to Me I am sanctified, and in the face of all the people I am honoured;&rsquo; and Aaron is silent.</p>
<p><strong>[10:4]</strong> And Moses calleth unto Mishael and unto Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron, and saith unto them, `Come near, bear your brethren from the front of the sanctuary unto the outside of the camp;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:5]</strong> and they come near, and bear them in their coats unto the outside of the camp, as Moses hath spoken.</p>
<p><strong>[10:6]</strong> And Moses saith unto Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar his sons, `Your heads ye do not uncover, and your garments ye do not rend, that ye die not, and on all the company He be wroth; as to your brethren, the whole house of Israel, they bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled;</p>
<p><strong>[10:7]</strong> and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go out, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah `is&rsquo; upon you;&rsquo; and they do according to the word of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[10:8]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[10:9]</strong> `Wine and strong drink thou dost not drink, thou, and thy sons with thee, in your going in unto the tent of meeting, and ye die not &ndash; a statute age-during to your generations;</p>
<p><strong>[10:10]</strong> so as to make a separation between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the pure;</p>
<p><strong>[10:11]</strong> and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:12]</strong> And Moses speaketh unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar his sons, who are left, <code>Take ye the present that is left from the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened near the altar, for it </code>is&rsquo; most holy,</p>
<p><strong>[10:13]</strong> and ye have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is&rsquo; thy portion, and the portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah; for so I have been commanded.</p>
<p><strong>[10:14]</strong> `And the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, ye do eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for thy portion and the portion of thy sons they have been given, out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the sons of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[10:15]</strong> the leg of the heave-offering, and breast of the wave-offering, besides fire-offerings of the fat, they do bring in to wave a wave-offering before Jehovah, and it hath been to thee, and to thy sons with thee, by a statute age-during, as Jehovah hath commanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:16]</strong> And the goat of the sin-offering hath Moses diligently sought, and lo, it is burnt, and he is wroth against Eleazar, and against Ithamar, sons of Aaron, who are left, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[10:17]</strong> <code>Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, for it </code>is&rsquo; most holy &ndash; and it He hath given to you to take away the iniquity of the company, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?</p>
<p><strong>[10:18]</strong> lo, its blood hath not been brought in unto the holy place within; eating ye do eat it in the holy place, as I have commanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:19]</strong> And Aaron speaketh unto Moses, <code>Lo, to-day they have brought near their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and </code>things&rsquo; like these meet me, yet I have eaten a sin-offering to-day; is it good in the eyes of Jehovah?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:20]</strong> And Moses hearkeneth, and it is good in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>[11:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them,</p>

<p><strong>[25:4]</strong> and in the seventh year a sabbath of rest is to the land, a sabbath to Jehovah; thy field thou dost not sow, and thy vineyard thou dost not prune;</p>
<p><strong>[25:5]</strong> the spontaneous growth of thy harvest thou dost not reap, and the grapes of thy separated thing thou dost not gather, a year of rest it is to the land.</p>
<p><strong>[25:6]</strong> `And the sabbath of the land hath been to you for food, to thee, and to thy man-servant, and to thy handmaid, and to thy hireling, and to thy settler, who are sojourning with thee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:7]</strong> and to thy cattle, and to the beast which `is&rsquo; in thy land, is all thine increase for food.</p>
<p><strong>[25:8]</strong> `And thou hast numbered to thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and the days of the seven sabbaths of years have been to thee nine and forty years,</p>
<p><strong>[25:9]</strong> and thou hast caused a trumpet of shouting to pass over in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month; in the day of the atonements ye do cause a trumpet to pass over through all your land;</p>
<p><strong>[25:10]</strong> and ye have hallowed the year, the fiftieth year; and ye have proclaimed liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; a jubilee it is to you; and ye have turned back each unto his possession; yea, each unto his family ye do turn back.</p>
<p><strong>[25:11]</strong> <code>A jubilee it </code>is&rsquo;, the fiftieth year, a year it is to you; ye sow not, nor reap its spontaneous growth, nor gather its separated things;</p>
<p><strong>[25:12]</strong> for a jubilee it `is&rsquo;, holy it is to you; out of the field ye eat its increase;</p>
<p><strong>[25:13]</strong> in the year of this jubilee ye turn back each unto his possession.</p>
<p><strong>[25:14]</strong> `And when thou sellest anything to thy fellow, or buyest from the hand of thy fellow, ye do not oppress one another;</p>
<p><strong>[25:15]</strong> by the number of years after the jubilee thou dost buy from thy fellow; by the number of the years of increase he doth sell to thee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:16]</strong> according to the multitude of the years thou dost multiply its price, and according to the fewness of the years thou dost diminish its price; for a number of increases he is selling to thee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:17]</strong> and ye do not oppress one another, and thou hast been afraid of thy God; for I `am&rsquo; Jehovah your God.</p>
<p><strong>[25:18]</strong> `And ye have done My statutes, and My judgments ye keep, and have done them, and ye have dwelt on the land confidently,</p>
<p><strong>[25:19]</strong> and the land hath given its fruit, and ye have eaten to satiety, and have dwelt confidently on it.</p>
<p><strong>[25:20]</strong> `And when ye say, What do we eat in the seventh year, lo, we do not sow, nor gather our increase?</p>
<p><strong>[25:21]</strong> then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it hath made the increase for three years;</p>
<p><strong>[25:22]</strong> and ye have sown the eighth year, and have eaten of the old increase; until the ninth year, until the coming in of its increase, ye do eat the old.</p>
<p><strong>[25:23]</strong> <code>And the land is not sold -- to extinction, for the land </code>is&rsquo; Mine, for sojourners and settlers `are&rsquo; ye with Me;</p>
<p><strong>[25:24]</strong> and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land.</p>
<p><strong>[25:25]</strong> `When thy brother becometh poor, and hath sold his possession, then hath his redeemer who is near unto him come, and he hath redeemed the sold thing of his brother;</p>
<p><strong>[25:26]</strong> and when a man hath no redeemer, and his own hand hath attained, and he hath found as sufficient `for&rsquo; its redemption,</p>
<p><strong>[25:27]</strong> then he hath reckoned the years of its sale, and hath given back that which is over to the man to whom he sold `it&rsquo;, and he hath returned to his possession.</p>
<p><strong>[25:28]</strong> `And if his hand hath not found sufficiency to give back to him, then hath his sold thing been in the hand of him who buyeth it till the year of jubilee; and it hath gone out in the jubilee, and he hath returned to his possession.</p>
<p><strong>[25:29]</strong> <code>And when a man selleth a dwelling-house </code>in&rsquo; a walled city, then hath his right of redemption been until the completion of a year from its selling; days &ndash; is his right of redemption;</p>
<p><strong>[25:30]</strong> and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year, then hath the house which `is&rsquo; in a walled city been established to extinction to the buyer of it, to his generations; it goeth not out in the jubilee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:31]</strong> and a house of the villages which have no wall round about, on the field of the country is reckoned; redemption is to it, and in the jubilee it goeth out.</p>
<p><strong>[25:32]</strong> `As to cities of the Levites &ndash; houses of the cities of their possession &ndash; redemption age-during is to the Levites;</p>
<p><strong>[25:33]</strong> as to him who redeemeth from the Levites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession have gone out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[25:34]</strong> And a field, a suburb of their cities, is not sold; for a possession age-during it `is&rsquo; to them.</p>
<p><strong>[25:35]</strong> `And when thy brother is become poor, and his hand hath failed with thee, then thou hast kept hold on him, sojourner and settler, and he hath lived with thee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:36]</strong> thou takest no usury from him, or increase; and thou hast been afraid of thy God; and thy brother hath lived with thee;</p>
<p><strong>[25:37]</strong> thy money thou givest not to him in usury, and for increase thou givest not thy food;</p>
<p><strong>[25:38]</strong> I `am&rsquo; Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to become your God.</p>
<p><strong>[25:39]</strong> `And when thy brother becometh poor with thee, and he hath been sold to thee, thou dost not lay on him servile service;</p>
<p><strong>[25:40]</strong> as an hireling, as a settler, he is with thee, till the year of the jubilee he doth serve with thee, &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[25:41]</strong> then he hath gone out from thee, he and his sons with him, and hath turned back unto his family; even unto the possession of his fathers he doth turn back.</p>
<p><strong>[25:42]</strong> <code>For they </code>are&rsquo; My servants, whom I have brought out from the land of Egypt: they are not sold `with&rsquo; the sale of a servant;</p>
<p><strong>[25:43]</strong> thou rulest not over him with rigour, and thou hast been afraid of thy God.</p>
<p><strong>[25:44]</strong> <code>And thy man-servant and thy handmaid whom thou hast </code>are&rsquo; of the nations who `are&rsquo; round about you; of them ye buy man-servant and handmaid,</p>
<p><strong>[25:45]</strong> and also of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you, of them ye buy, and of their families who `are&rsquo; with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they have been to you for a possession;</p>
<p><strong>[25:46]</strong> and ye have taken them for inheritance to your sons after you, to occupy `for&rsquo; a possession; to the age ye lay service upon them, but upon your brethren, the sons of Israel, one with another, thou dost not rule over him with rigour.</p>
<p><strong>[25:47]</strong> <code>And when the hand of a sojourner or settler with thee attaineth </code>riches&rsquo;, and thy brother with him hath become poor, and he hath been sold to a sojourner, a settler with thee, or to the root of the family of a sojourner,</p>
<p><strong>[25:48]</strong> after he hath been sold, there is a right of redemption to him; one of his brethren doth redeem him,</p>
<p><strong>[25:49]</strong> or his uncle, or a son of his uncle, doth redeem him, or any of the relations of his flesh, of his family, doth redeem him, or &ndash; his own hand hath attained &ndash; then he hath been redeemed.</p>
<p><strong>[25:50]</strong> `And he hath reckoned with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him till the year of jubilee, and the money of his sale hath been by the number of years; as the days of an hireling it is with him.</p>
<p><strong>[25:51]</strong> <code>If yet many years, according to them he giveth back his redemption </code>money&rsquo;, from the money of his purchase.</p>
<p><strong>[25:52]</strong> <code>And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee, then he hath reckoned with him, according to his years he doth give back his redemption </code>money&rsquo;;</p>
<p><strong>[25:53]</strong> as an hireling, year by year, he is with him, and he doth not rule him with rigour before thine eyes.</p>
<p><strong>[25:54]</strong> <code>And if he is not redeemed in these </code>years&rsquo;, then he hath gone out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.</p>
<p><strong>[25:55]</strong> For to Me <code>are' the sons of Israel servants; My servants they </code>are&rsquo;, whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, `am&rsquo; your God.</p>
<p><strong>[26:1]</strong> <code>Ye do not make to yourselves idols; and graven image or standing image ye do not set up to yourselves; and a stone of imagery ye do not put in your land, to bow yourselves to it; for I </code>am&rsquo; Jehovah your God.</p>
<p><strong>[26:2]</strong> <code>My sabbaths ye do keep, and My sanctuary ye do reverence; I </code>am&rsquo; Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[26:3]</strong> `If in My statutes ye walk, and My commands ye keep, and have done them,</p>
<p><strong>[26:4]</strong> then I have given your rains in their season, and the land hath given her produce, and the tree of the field doth give its fruit;</p>
<p><strong>[26:5]</strong> and reached to you hath the threshing, the gathering, and the gathering doth reach the sowing-`time&rsquo;; and ye have eaten your bread to satiety, and have dwelt confidently in your land.</p>
<p><strong>[26:6]</strong> `And I have given peace in the land, and ye have lain down, and there is none causing trembling; and I have caused evil beasts to cease out of the land, and the sword doth not pass over into your land.</p>
<p><strong>[26:7]</strong> `And ye have pursued your enemies, and they have fallen before you by the sword;</p>
<p><strong>[26:8]</strong> and five of you have pursued a hundred, and a hundred of you do pursue a myriad; and your enemies have fallen before you by the sword.</p>
<p><strong>[26:9]</strong> `And I have turned unto you, and have made you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and have established My covenant with you;</p>
<p><strong>[26:10]</strong> and ye have eaten old `store&rsquo;, and the old because of the new ye bring out.</p>
<p><strong>[26:11]</strong> `And I have given My tabernacle in your midst, and My soul doth not loathe you;</p>
<p><strong>[26:12]</strong> and I have walked habitually in your midst, and have become your God, and ye &ndash; ye are become My people;</p>
<p><strong>[26:13]</strong> I `am&rsquo; Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, from being their servants; and I break the bars of your yoke, and cause you to go erect.</p>
<p><strong>[26:14]</strong> `And if ye do not hearken to Me, and do not all these commands;</p>
<p><strong>[26:15]</strong> and if at My statutes ye kick, and if My judgments your soul loathe, so as not to do all My commands &ndash; to your breaking My covenant &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[26:16]</strong> I also do this to you, and I have appointed over you trouble, the consumption, and the burning fever, consuming eyes, and causing pain of soul; and your seed in vain ye have sowed, and your enemies have eaten it;</p>
<p><strong>[26:17]</strong> and I have set My face against you, and ye have been smitten before your enemies; and those hating you have ruled over you, and ye have fled, and there is none pursuing you.</p>
<p><strong>[26:18]</strong> `And if unto these ye hearken not to Me, &ndash; then I have added to chastise you seven times for your sins;</p>
<p><strong>[26:19]</strong> and I have broken the pride of your strength, and have made your heavens as iron, and your earth as brass;</p>
<p><strong>[26:20]</strong> and consumed hath been your strength in vain, and your land doth not give her produce, and the tree of the land doth not give its fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[26:21]</strong> <code>And if ye walk with Me </code>in&rsquo; opposition, and are not willing to hearken to Me, then I have added to you a plague seven times, according to your sins,</p>
<p><strong>[26:22]</strong> and sent against you the beast of the field, and it hath bereaved you; and I have cut off your cattle, and have made you few, and your ways have been desolate.</p>
<p><strong>[26:23]</strong> <code>And if by these ye are not instructed by Me, and have walked with Me </code>in&rsquo; opposition,</p>
<p><strong>[26:24]</strong> then I have walked &ndash; I also &ndash; with you in opposition, and have smitten you, even I, seven times for your sins;</p>
<p><strong>[26:25]</strong> and I have brought in on you a sword, executing the vengeance of a covenant; and ye have been gathered unto your cities, and I have sent pestilence into your midst, and ye have been given into the hand of an enemy.</p>
<p><strong>[26:26]</strong> `In My breaking to you the staff of bread, then ten women have baked your bread in one oven, and have given back your bread by weight; and ye have eaten, and are not satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>[26:27]</strong> `And if for this ye hearken not to Me, and have walked with Me in opposition,</p>
<p><strong>[26:28]</strong> then I have walked with you in the fury of opposition, and have chastised you, even I, seven times for your sins.</p>
<p><strong>[26:29]</strong> `And ye have eaten the flesh of your sons; even flesh of your daughters ye do eat.</p>
<p><strong>[26:30]</strong> And I have destroyed your high places, and cut down your images, and have put your carcases on the carcases of your idols, and My soul hath loathed you;</p>
<p><strong>[26:31]</strong> and I have made your cities a waste, and have made desolate your sanctuaries, and I smell not at your sweet fragrances;</p>
<p><strong>[26:32]</strong> and I have made desolate the land, and your enemies, who are dwelling in it, have been astonished at it.</p>
<p><strong>[26:33]</strong> And you I scatter among nations, and have drawn out after you a sword, and your land hath been a desolation, and your cities are a waste.</p>
<p><strong>[26:34]</strong> `Then doth the land enjoy its sabbaths &ndash; all the days of the desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies &ndash; then doth the land rest, and hath enjoyed its sabbaths;</p>
<p><strong>[26:35]</strong> all the days of the desolation it resteth that which it hath not rested in your sabbaths in your dwelling on it.</p>
<p><strong>[26:36]</strong> `And those who are left of you &ndash; I have also brought a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a leaf driven away hath pursued them, and they have fled &ndash; flight from a sword &ndash; and they have fallen, and there is none pursuing.</p>
<p><strong>[26:37]</strong> And they have stumbled one on another, as from the face of a sword, and there is none pursuing, and ye have no standing before your enemies,</p>
<p><strong>[26:38]</strong> and ye have perished among the nations, and the land of your enemies hath consumed you.</p>
<p><strong>[26:39]</strong> `And those who are left of you &ndash; they consume away in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, with them they consume away.</p>
<p><strong>[26:40]</strong> `And &ndash; they have confessed their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they have trespassed against Me, and also, that they have walked with Me, in opposition,</p>
<p><strong>[26:41]</strong> also I walk to them in opposition, and have brought them into the land of their enemies &ndash; or then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity, &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[26:42]</strong> then I have remembered My covenant <code>with' Jacob, and also My covenant </code>with&rsquo; Isaac, and also My covenant `with&rsquo; Abraham I remember, and the land I remember.</p>
<p><strong>[26:43]</strong> `And &ndash; the land is left of them, and doth enjoy its sabbaths, in the desolation without them, and they accept the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because, against My judgments they have kicked, and My statutes hath their soul loathed,</p>
<p><strong>[26:44]</strong> and also even this, in their being in the land of their enemies, I have not rejected them, nor have I loathed them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I `am&rsquo; Jehovah their God; &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[26:45]</strong> then I have remembered for them the covenant of the ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to become their God; I `am&rsquo; Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[26:46]</strong> These `are&rsquo; the statutes, and the judgments, and the laws, which Jehovah hath given between Him and the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[27:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[27:2]</strong> <code>Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When a man maketh a wonderful vow, by thy valuation the persons </code>are&rsquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>[27:3]</strong> When thy valuation hath been of the male from a son of twenty years even unto a son of sixty years, then hath been thy valuation fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>[27:4]</strong> And if it `is&rsquo; a female &ndash; then hath thy valuation been thirty shekels;</p>
<p><strong>[27:5]</strong> and if from a son of five years even unto a son of twenty years &ndash; then hath thy valuation been of the male twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels;</p>
<p><strong>[27:6]</strong> and if from a son of a month even unto a son of five years &ndash; then hath thy valuation been of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation `is&rsquo; three shekels of silver;</p>
<p><strong>[27:7]</strong> and if from a son of sixty years and above &ndash; if a male, then hath thy valuation been fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.</p>
<p><strong>[27:8]</strong> `And if he is poorer than thy valuation, then he hath presented himself before the priest, and the priest hath valued him; according to that which the hand of him who is vowing doth reach doth the priest value him.</p>
<p><strong>[27:9]</strong> <code>And if </code>it is&rsquo; a beast of which they bring near an offering to Jehovah, all that `one&rsquo; giveth of it to Jehovah is holy;</p>
<p><strong>[27:10]</strong> he doth not change it nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he really change beast for beast, &ndash; then it hath been &ndash; it and its exchange is holy.</p>
<p><strong>[27:11]</strong> <code>And if </code>it is&rsquo; any unclean beast of which they do not bring near an offering to Jehovah, then he hath presented the beast before the priest,</p>
<p><strong>[27:12]</strong> and the priest hath valued it; whether good or bad, according to thy valuation, O priest, so it is;</p>
<p><strong>[27:13]</strong> and if he really redeem it, then he hath added its fifth to thy valuation.</p>
<p><strong>[27:14]</strong> `And when a man sanctifieth his house, a holy thing to Jehovah, then hath the priest valued it, whether good or bad; as the priest doth value it so it standeth;</p>
<p><strong>[27:15]</strong> and if he who is sanctifying doth redeem his house, then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath become his.</p>
<p><strong>[27:16]</strong> `And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to Jehovah, then hath thy valuation been according to its seed; a homer of barley-seed at fifty shekels of silver;</p>
<p><strong>[27:17]</strong> if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to thy valuation it standeth;</p>
<p><strong>[27:18]</strong> and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then hath the priest reckoned to him the money according to the years which are left, unto the year of the jubilee, and it hath been abated from thy valuation.</p>
<p><strong>[27:19]</strong> `And if he really redeem the field &ndash; he who is sanctifying it &ndash; then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath been established to him;</p>
<p><strong>[27:20]</strong> and if he do not redeem the field, or if he hath sold the field to another man, it is not redeemed any more;</p>
<p><strong>[27:21]</strong> and the field hath been, in its going out in the jubilee, holy to Jehovah as a field which is devoted; to the priest is its possession.</p>
<p><strong>[27:22]</strong> <code>And if the field of his purchase (which </code>is&rsquo; not of the fields of his possession) `one&rsquo; sanctify to Jehovah &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[27:23]</strong> then hath the priest reckoned to him the amount of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee, and he hath given thy valuation in that day &ndash; a holy thing to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[27:24]</strong> in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from whom he bought it, to him whose `is&rsquo; the possession of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[27:25]</strong> And all thy valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs is the shekel.</p>
<p><strong>[27:26]</strong> <code>Only, a firstling which is Jehovah's firstling among beasts -- no man doth sanctify it, whether ox or sheep; it </code>is&rsquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>[27:27]</strong> And if among the unclean beasts, then he hath ransomed `it&rsquo; at thy valuation, and he hath added its fifth to it; and if it is not redeemed, then it hath been sold at thy valuation.</p>
<p><strong>[27:28]</strong> `Only, no devoted thing which a man devoteth to Jehovah, of all that he hath, of man, and beast, and of the field of his possession, is sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[27:29]</strong> `No devoted thing, which is devoted of man, is ransomed, it is surely put to death.</p>
<p><strong>[27:30]</strong> And all tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah&rsquo;s &ndash; holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[27:31]</strong> <code>And if a man really redeem </code>any&rsquo; of his tithe, its fifth he addeth to it.</p>
<p><strong>[27:32]</strong> `And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock &ndash; all that passeth by under the rod &ndash; the tenth is holy to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[27:33]</strong> he enquireth not between good and bad, nor doth he change it; and if he really change it &ndash; then it hath been &ndash; it and its exchange is holy; it is not redeemed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[27:34]</strong> These `are&rsquo; the commands which Jehovah hath commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai.</p>
