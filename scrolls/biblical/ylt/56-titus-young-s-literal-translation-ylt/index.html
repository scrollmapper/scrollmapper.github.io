<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that `is&rsquo; according to piety,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> to Titus &ndash; true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God&rsquo;s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> holding &ndash; according to the teaching &ndash; to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers &ndash; especially they of the circumcision &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said &ndash; `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> all things, indeed, <code>are' pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast </code>is&rsquo; nothing pure, but of them defiled `are&rsquo; even the mind and the conscience;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> God they profess to know, and in the works they deny `Him&rsquo;, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> And thou &ndash; be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of <code>their' husbands, lovers of </code>their&rsquo; children,</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> sober, pure, keepers of `their own&rsquo; houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> Servants &ndash; to their own masters `are&rsquo; to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome &ndash; gentle, showing all meekness to all men,</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> for we were once &ndash; also we &ndash; thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious &ndash; hating one another;</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> (not by works that `are&rsquo; in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Stedfast `is&rsquo; the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works &ndash; who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from &ndash; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> having known that he hath been subverted who `is&rsquo; such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> and let them learn &ndash; ours also &ndash; to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace `is&rsquo; with you all!</p>
