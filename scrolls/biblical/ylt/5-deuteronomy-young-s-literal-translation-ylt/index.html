    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> These `are&rsquo; the words which Moses hath spoken unto all Israel, beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain over-against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-Zahab;</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> eleven days&rsquo; from Horeb, the way of mount Seir, unto Kadesh-Barnea.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> And it cometh to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month hath Moses spoken unto the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him concerning them;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> after his smiting Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan who is dwelling in Ashtaroth in Edrei,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, hath Moses begun to explain this law, saying:</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> `Jehovah our God hath spoken unto us in Horeb, saying, Enough to you &ndash; of dwelling in this mount;</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> turn ye and journey for you, and enter the mount of the Amorite, and unto all its neighbouring places, in the plain, in the hill-country, and in the low country, and in the south, and in the haven of the sea, the land of the Canaanite, and of Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Phrat;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> see, I have set before you the land; go in and possess the land which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them, and to their seed after them.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> `And I speak unto you at that time, saying, I am not able by myself to bear you;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and lo, ye `are&rsquo; to-day as the stars of the heavens for multitude;</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> Jehovah, God of your fathers, is adding to you, as ye `are&rsquo;, a thousand times, and doth bless you as He hath spoken to you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> `How do I bear by myself your pressure, and your burden, and your strife?</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Give for yourselves men, wise and intelligent, and known to your tribes, and I set them for your heads;</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> and ye answer me and say, Good `is&rsquo; the thing which thou hast spoken &ndash; to do.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> `And I take the heads of your tribes, men, wise and known, and I appoint them heads over you, princes of thousands, and princes of hundreds, and princes of fifties, and princes of tens, and authorities, for your tribes.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> And I command your judges at that time, saying, Hearkening between your brethren &ndash; then ye have judged righteousness between a man, and his brother, and his sojourner;</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> ye do not discern faces in judgment; as the little so the great ye do hear; ye are not afraid of the face of any, for the judgment is God&rsquo;s, and the thing which is too hard for you, ye bring near unto me, and I have heard it;</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> and I command you, at that time, all the things which ye do.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> <code>And we journey from Horeb, and go </code>through&rsquo; all that great and fearful wilderness which ye have seen &ndash; the way of the hill-country of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God hath commanded us, and we come in unto Kadesh-Barnea.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> `And I say unto you, Ye have come in unto the hill-country of the Amorite, which Jehovah our God is giving to us;</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> see, Jehovah thy God hath set before thee the land; go up, possess, as Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath spoken to thee; fear not, nor be affrighted.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> <code>And ye come near unto me, all of you, and say, Let us send men before us, and they search for us the land, and they bring us back word </code>concerning&rsquo; the way in which we go up into it, and the cities unto which we come in;</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> and the thing is good in mine eyes, and I take of you twelve men, one man for a tribe.</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> `And they turn and go up to the hill-country, and come in unto the valley of Eshcol, and spy it,</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> and they take with their hand of the fruit of the land, and bring down unto us, and bring us back word, and say, Good is the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</p>
<p><strong>[1:26]</strong> `And ye have not been willing to go up, and ye provoke the mouth of Jehovah your God,</p>
<p><strong>[1:27]</strong> and murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah&rsquo;s hating us He hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorite &ndash; to destroy us;</p>
<p><strong>[1:28]</strong> whither are we going up? our brethren have melted our heart, saying, A people greater and taller than we, cities great and fenced to heaven, and also sons of Anakim &ndash; we have seen there.</p>
<p><strong>[1:29]</strong> `And I say unto you, Be not terrified, nor be afraid of them;</p>
<p><strong>[1:30]</strong> Jehovah your God, who is going before you &ndash; He doth fight for you, according to all that He hath done with you in Egypt before your eyes,</p>
<p><strong>[1:31]</strong> and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God hath borne thee as a man beareth his son, in all the way which ye have gone, till your coming in unto this place.</p>
<p><strong>[1:32]</strong> `And in this thing ye are not stedfast in Jehovah your God,</p>
<p><strong>[1:33]</strong> who is going before you in the way to search out to you a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you in the way in which ye go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
<p><strong>[1:34]</strong> `And Jehovah heareth the voice of your words, and is wroth, and sweareth, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[1:35]</strong> Not one of these men of this evil generation doth see the good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:36]</strong> save Caleb son of Jephunneh &ndash; he doth see it, and to him I give the land on which he hath trodden, and to his sons, because that he hath been fully after Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:37]</strong> `Also with me hath Jehovah been angry for your sake, saying, Also, thou dost not go in thither;</p>
<p><strong>[1:38]</strong> Joshua son of Nun, who is standing before thee, he goeth in thither; him strengthen thou; for he doth cause Israel to inherit.</p>
<p><strong>[1:39]</strong> `And your infants, of whom ye have said, For a prey they are, and your sons who have not known to-day good and evil, they go in thither, and to them I give it, and they possess it;</p>
<p><strong>[1:40]</strong> and ye, turn for yourselves, and journey toward the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea.</p>
<p><strong>[1:41]</strong> `And ye answer and say unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we &ndash; we go up, and we have fought, according to all that which Jehovah our God hath commanded us; and ye gird on each his weapons of war, and ye are ready to go up into the hill-country;</p>
<p><strong>[1:42]</strong> and Jehovah saith unto me, Say to them, Ye do not go up, nor fight, for I am not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>[1:43]</strong> `And I speak unto you, and ye have not hearkened, and provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and act proudly, and go up into the hill-country;</p>
<p><strong>[1:44]</strong> and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country cometh out to meet you, and they pursue you as the bees do, and smite you in Seir &ndash; unto Hormah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:45]</strong> `And ye turn back and weep before Jehovah, and Jehovah hath not hearkened to your voice, nor hath he given ear unto you;</p>
<p><strong>[1:46]</strong> and ye dwell in Kadesh many days, according to the days which ye had dwelt.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> `And we turn, and journey into the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea, as Jehovah hath spoken unto me, and we go round the mount of Seir many days.</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> `And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> Enough to you &ndash; is the going round of this mount; turn for yourselves northward.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> `And the people command thou, saying, Ye are passing over into the border of your brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, and they are afraid of you; and ye have been very watchful,</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> ye do not strive with them, for I do not give to you of their land even the treading of the sole of a foot; for a possession to Esau I have given mount Seir.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> `Food ye buy from them with money, and have eaten; and also water ye buy from them with money, and have drunk,</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hands; He hath known thy walking in this great wilderness these forty years; Jehovah thy God `is&rsquo; with thee; thou hast not lacked anything.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> `And we pass by from our brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, by the way of the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-Gaber; and we turn, and pass over the way of the wilderness of Moab;</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> and Jehovah saith unto me, Do not distress Moab, nor stir thyself up against them <code>in' battle, for I do not give to thee of their land </code>for&rsquo; a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar `for&rsquo; a possession.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> `The Emim formerly have dwelt in it, a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim;</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> Rephaim they are reckoned, they also, as the Anakim; and the Moabites call them Emim.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> And in Seir have the Horim dwelt formerly; and the sons of Esau dispossess them, and destroy them from before them, and dwell in their stead, as Israel hath done to the land of his possession, which Jehovah hath given to them;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> now, rise ye, and pass over for yourselves the brook Zered; and we pass over the brook Zered.</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> <code>And the days which we have walked from Kadesh-Barnea until that we have passed over the brook Zered, </code>are&rsquo; thirty and eight years, till the consumption of all the generation of the men of battle from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah hath sworn to them;</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> and also the hand of Jehovah hath been against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, till they are consumed.</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> `And it cometh to pass, when all the men of battle have finished dying from the midst of the people,</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> that Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> Thou art passing over to-day the border of Moab, even Ar,</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> and thou hast come near over-against the sons of Ammon, thou dost not distress them, nor stir up thyself against them, for I do not give <code>any' of the land of the sons of Ammon to thee </code>for&rsquo; a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given it `for&rsquo; a possession.</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> `A land of Rephaim it is reckoned, even it; Rephaim dwelt in it formerly, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim, and Jehovah destroyeth them before them, and they dispossess them, and dwell in their stead,</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> as He hath done for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, when He destroyed the Horim from before them, and they dispossess them, and dwell in their stead, unto this day.</p>
<p><strong>[2:23]</strong> `As to the Avim who are dwelling in Hazerim unto Azzah, the Caphtorim &ndash; who are coming out from Caphtor &ndash; have destroyed them, and dwell in their stead.</p>
<p><strong>[2:24]</strong> <code>Rise ye, journey and pass over the brook Arnon; see, I have given into thy hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land; begin to possess, and stir up thyself against him </code>in&rsquo; battle.</p>
<p><strong>[2:25]</strong> This day I begin to put thy dread and thy fear on the face of the peoples under the whole heavens, who hear thy fame, and have trembled and been pained because of thee.</p>
<p><strong>[2:26]</strong> `And I send messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth, unto Sihon king of Heshbon, &ndash; words of peace &ndash; saying,</p>
<p><strong>[2:27]</strong> Let me pass over through thy land; in the several ways I go; I turn not aside &ndash; right or left &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[2:28]</strong> food for money thou dost sell me, and I have eaten; and water for money thou dost give to me, and I have drunk; only, let me pass over on my feet, &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[2:29]</strong> as the sons of Esau who are dwelling in Seir, and the Moabites who are dwelling in Ar, have done to me &ndash; till that I pass over the Jordan, unto the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</p>
<p><strong>[2:30]</strong> `And Sihon king of Heshbon hath not been willing to let us pass over by him, for Jehovah thy God hath hardened his spirit, and strengthened his heart, so as to give him into thy hand as at this day.</p>
<p><strong>[2:31]</strong> `And Jehovah saith unto me, See, I have begun to give before thee Sihon and his land; begin to possess &ndash; to possess his land.</p>
<p><strong>[2:32]</strong> `And Sihon cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle to Jahaz;</p>
<p><strong>[2:33]</strong> and Jehovah our God giveth him before us, and we smite him, and his sons, and all his people;</p>
<p><strong>[2:34]</strong> and we capture all his cities at that time, and devote the whole city, men, and the women, and the infants &ndash; we have not left a remnant;</p>
<p><strong>[2:35]</strong> only, the cattle we have spoiled for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we have captured.</p>
<p><strong>[2:36]</strong> <code>From Aroer, which </code>is&rsquo; by the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which <code>is' by the brook, even unto Gilead there hath not been a city which </code>is&rsquo; too high for us; the whole hath Jehovah our God given before us.</p>
<p><strong>[2:37]</strong> <code>Only, unto the land of the sons of Ammon thou hast not drawn near, any part of the brook Jabbok, and cities of the hill-country, and anything which Jehovah our God hath </code>not&rsquo; commanded.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> <code>And we turn, and go up the way to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle, </code>to&rsquo; Edrei.</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> `And Jehovah saith unto me, Fear him not, for into thy hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and thou hast done to him as thou hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon.</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> `And Jehovah our God giveth into our hands also Og king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smite him till there hath not been left to him a remnant;</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> and we capture all his cities at that time, there hath not been a city which we have not taken from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> All these `are&rsquo; cities fenced with high walls, two-leaved doors and bar, apart from cities of villages very many;</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> and we devote them, as we have done to Sihon king of Heshbon, devoting every city, men, the women, and the infants;</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> and all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we have spoiled for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> `And we take, at that time, the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorite, which is beyond the Jordan, from the brook Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> (Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir,)</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan,</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> for only Og king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; lo, his bedstead `is&rsquo; a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length, and four cubits its breadth, by the cubit of a man.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> <code>And this land we have possessed, at that time; from Aroer, which </code>is&rsquo; by the brook Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I have given to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite;</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> and the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I have given to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, to all that Bashan, called the land of Rephaim.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> `Jair son of Manasseh hath taken all the region of Argob, unto the border of Geshuri, and Maachathi, and calleth them by his own name, Bashan-Havoth-Jair, unto this day.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> And to Machir I have given Gilead.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> `And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite I have given from Gilead even unto the brook Arnon, the middle of the valley and the border, even unto Jabbok the brook, the border of the sons of Ammon,</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> and the plain, and the Jordan, and the border, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the springs of Pisgah, at the `sun&rsquo;-rising.</p>
<p><strong>[3:18]</strong> `And I command you, at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given to you this land to possess it; armed ye pass over before your brethren the sons of Israel, all the sons of might.</p>
<p><strong>[3:19]</strong> Only, your wives, and your infants, and your cattle &ndash; I have known that ye have much cattle &ndash; do dwell in your cities which I have given to you,</p>
<p><strong>[3:20]</strong> till that Jehovah give rest to your brethren like yourselves, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan, then ye have turned back each to his possession, which I have given to you.</p>
<p><strong>[3:21]</strong> `And Jehoshua I have commanded at that time, saying, Thine eyes are seeing all that which Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings &ndash; so doth Jehovah to all the kingdoms whither thou are passing over;</p>
<p><strong>[3:22]</strong> fear them not, for Jehovah your God, He is fighting for you.</p>
<p><strong>[3:23]</strong> `And I entreat for grace unto Jehovah, at that time, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[3:24]</strong> Lord Jehovah, Thou &ndash; Thou hast begun to shew Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for who `is&rsquo; a God in the heavens or in earth who doth according to Thy works, and according to Thy might?</p>
<p><strong>[3:25]</strong> Let me pass over, I pray Thee, and see the good land which `is&rsquo; beyond the Jordan, this good hill-country, and Lebanon.</p>
<p><strong>[3:26]</strong> `And Jehovah sheweth himself wroth with me, for your sake, and hath not hearkened unto me, and Jehovah saith unto me, Enough for thee; add not to speak unto Me any more about this thing:</p>
<p><strong>[3:27]</strong> go up `to&rsquo; the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with thine eyes &ndash; for thou dost not pass over this Jordan;</p>
<p><strong>[3:28]</strong> and charge Jehoshua, and strengthen him, and harden him, for he doth pass over before this people, and he doth cause them to inherit the land which thou seest.</p>
<p><strong>[3:29]</strong> `And we dwell in a valley over-against Beth-Peor.</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> `And now, Israel, hearken unto the statutes, and unto the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye live, and have gone in, and possessed the land which Jehovah God of your fathers is giving to you.</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> Ye do not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor diminish from it, to keep the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> `Your eyes are seeing that which Jehovah hath done in Baal-Peor, for every man who hath gone after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed him from thy midst;</p>

<p><strong>[9:5]</strong> not for thy righteousness, and for the uprightness of thy heart, art thou going in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations is Jehovah thy God dispossessing them from before thee; and in order to establish the word which Jehovah hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;</p>
<p><strong>[9:6]</strong> and thou hast known, that not for thy righteousness is Jehovah thy God giving to thee this good land to possess it, for a people stiff of neck thou `art&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>[9:7]</strong> <code>Remember -- do not forget -- that </code>with&rsquo; which thou hast made Jehovah thy God wroth in the wilderness; even from the day that thou hast come out of the land of Egypt till your coming in unto this place rebels ye have been with Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[9:8]</strong> even in Horeb ye have made Jehovah wroth, and Jehovah sheweth Himself angry against you &ndash; to destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>[9:9]</strong> `In my going up into the mount to receive the tables of stone (tables of the covenant which Jehovah hath made with you), and I abide in the mount forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk;</p>
<p><strong>[9:10]</strong> and Jehovah giveth unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them according to all the words which Jehovah hath spoken with you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.</p>
<p><strong>[9:11]</strong> `And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, Jehovah hath given unto me the two tables of stone &ndash; tables of the covenant,</p>
<p><strong>[9:12]</strong> and Jehovah saith unto me, Rise, go down, hasten from this, for thy people hath done corruptly, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt; they have turned aside hastily out of the way which I have commanded them &ndash; they have made to themselves a molten thing!</p>
<p><strong>[9:13]</strong> <code>And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and lo, a people stiff of neck it </code>is&rsquo;;</p>
<p><strong>[9:14]</strong> desist from Me, and I destroy them, and blot out their name from under the heavens, and I make thee become a nation more mighty and numerous than it.</p>
<p><strong>[9:15]</strong> `And I turn, and come down from the mount, and the mount is burning with fire, and the two tables of the covenant on my two hands,</p>
<p><strong>[9:16]</strong> and I see, and lo, ye have sinned against Jehovah your God; ye have made to yourselves a molten calf; ye have turned aside hastily out of the way which Jehovah hath commanded you.</p>
<p><strong>[9:17]</strong> `And I lay hold on the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and break them before your eyes,</p>
<p><strong>[9:18]</strong> and I throw myself before Jehovah, as at first, forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk, because of all your sins which ye have sinned, by doing the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry.</p>
<p><strong>[9:19]</strong> `For I have been afraid because of the anger and the fury with which Jehovah hath been wroth against you, to destroy you; and Jehovah doth hearken unto me also at this time.</p>
<p><strong>[9:20]</strong> `And with Aaron hath Jehovah shewed himself very angry, to destroy him, and I pray also for Aaron at that time;</p>
<p><strong>[9:21]</strong> and your sin, which ye have made &ndash; the calf &ndash; I have taken, and I burn it with fire, and beat it, grinding well till that it `is&rsquo; small as dust, and I cast its dust unto the brook which is going down out of the mount.</p>
<p><strong>[9:22]</strong> `And in Taberah, and in Massah, and in Kibroth-Hattaavah, ye have been making Jehovah wroth:</p>
<p><strong>[9:23]</strong> and in Jehovah&rsquo;s sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, Go up, and possess the land which I have given to you, then ye provoke the mouth of Jehovah your God, and have not given credence to Him, nor hearkened to His voice;</p>
<p><strong>[9:24]</strong> rebels ye have been with Jehovah from the day of my knowing you.</p>
<p><strong>[9:25]</strong> `And I throw myself before Jehovah, the forty days and the forty nights, as I had thrown myself, for Jehovah hath said &ndash; to destroy you;</p>
<p><strong>[9:26]</strong> and I pray unto Jehovah, and say, Lord Jehovah, destroy not Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast ransomed in Thy greatness; whom Thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand;</p>
<p><strong>[9:27]</strong> be mindful of Thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, turn not unto the stiffness of this people, and unto its wickedness, and unto its sin;</p>
<p><strong>[9:28]</strong> lest the land say from which Thou hast brought us out, Because of Jehovah&rsquo;s want of ability to bring them in unto the land of which He hath spoken to them, and because of His hating them, He brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness;</p>
<p><strong>[9:29]</strong> and they `are&rsquo; Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast brought out by Thy great power, and by Thy stretched-out arm!</p>
<p><strong>[10:1]</strong> `At that time hath Jehovah said unto me, Grave for thee two tables of stone, like the first, and come up unto Me, into the mount, and thou hast made for thee an ark of wood,</p>
<p><strong>[10:2]</strong> and I write on the tables the words which were on the first tables, which thou hast broken, and thou hast placed them in the ark;</p>
<p><strong>[10:3]</strong> and I make an ark of shittim wood, and grave two tables of stone like the first, and go up to the mount, and the two tables in my hand.</p>
<p><strong>[10:4]</strong> `And He writeth on the tables, according to the first writing, the Ten Matters, which Jehovah hath spoken unto you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly, and Jehovah giveth them unto me,</p>
<p><strong>[10:5]</strong> and I turn and come down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made, and they are there, as Jehovah commanded me.</p>
<p><strong>[10:6]</strong> `And the sons of Israel have journeyed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera, there Aaron died, and he is buried there, and Eleazar his son doth act as priest in his stead;</p>
<p><strong>[10:7]</strong> thence they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.</p>
<p><strong>[10:8]</strong> `At that time hath Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah, to serve Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day,</p>
<p><strong>[10:9]</strong> therefore there hath not been to Levi a portion and inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah Himself `is&rsquo; his inheritance, as Jehovah thy God hath spoken to him.</p>
<p><strong>[10:10]</strong> `And I &ndash; I have stood in the mount, as the former days, forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah hearkeneth unto me also at that time; Jehovah hath not willed to destroy thee.</p>
<p><strong>[10:11]</strong> `And Jehovah saith unto me, Rise, go to journey before the people, and they go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.</p>
<p><strong>[10:12]</strong> `And now, Israel, what is Jehovah thy God asking from thee, except to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,</p>
<p><strong>[10:13]</strong> to keep the commands of Jehovah, and His statutes which I am commanding thee to-day, for good to thee?</p>
<p><strong>[10:14]</strong> <code>Lo, to Jehovah thy God </code>are&rsquo; the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that `is&rsquo; in it;</p>
<p><strong>[10:15]</strong> only in thy fathers hath Jehovah delighted &ndash; to love them, and He doth fix on their seed after them &ndash; on you, out of all the peoples as `at&rsquo; this day;</p>
<p><strong>[10:16]</strong> and ye have circumcised the foreskin of your heart, and your neck ye do not harden any more;</p>
<p><strong>[10:17]</strong> for Jehovah your God &ndash; He `is&rsquo; God of the gods, and Lord of the lords; God, the great, the mighty, and the fearful; who accepteth not persons, nor taketh a bribe;</p>
<p><strong>[10:18]</strong> He is doing the judgment of fatherless and widow, and loving the sojourner, to give to him bread and raiment.</p>
<p><strong>[10:19]</strong> `And ye have loved the sojourner, for sojourners ye were in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[10:20]</strong> `Jehovah thy God thou dost fear, Him thou dost serve, and to Him thou dost cleave, and by His name thou dost swear.</p>
<p><strong>[10:21]</strong> He <code>is' thy praise, and He </code>is&rsquo; thy God, who hath done with thee these great and fearful `things&rsquo; which thine eyes have seen:</p>
<p><strong>[10:22]</strong> with seventy persons did thy fathers go down to Egypt, and now hath Jehovah thy God made thee as stars of the heavens for multitude.</p>
<p><strong>[11:1]</strong> `And thou hast loved Jehovah thy God, and kept His charge, and His statutes, and His judgments, and His commands, all the days;</p>
<p><strong>[11:2]</strong> and ye have known to-day &ndash; for it is not your sons who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, His greatness, His strong hand, and His stretched-out arm,</p>
<p><strong>[11:3]</strong> and His signs, and His doings, which He hath done in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;</p>
<p><strong>[11:4]</strong> and that which He hath done to the force of Egypt, to its horses, and to its chariot, when He hath caused the waters of the Red Sea to flow against their faces in their pursuing after them, and Jehovah destroyeth them, unto this day;</p>
<p><strong>[11:5]</strong> and that which He hath done to you in the wilderness, till your coming in unto this place;</p>
<p><strong>[11:6]</strong> and that which He hath done to Dathan, and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, sons of Reuben, when the earth hath opened her mouth and swalloweth them, and their houses, and their tents, and all that liveth, which is at their feet, in the midst of all Israel:</p>
<p><strong>[11:7]</strong> <code>-- But </code>it is&rsquo; your eyes which are seeing all the great work of Jehovah, which He hath done;</p>
<p><strong>[11:8]</strong> and ye have kept all the command which I am commanding thee to-day, so that ye are strong, and have gone in, and possessed the land whither ye are passing over to possess it,</p>
<p><strong>[11:9]</strong> and so that ye prolong days on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to give to them and to their seed &ndash; a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p><strong>[11:10]</strong> `For the land whither thou art going in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt whence ye have come out, where thou sowest thy seed, and hast watered with thy foot, as a garden of the green herb;</p>
<p><strong>[11:11]</strong> but the land whither ye are passing over to possess it, `is&rsquo; a land of hills and valleys; of the rain of the heavens it drinketh water;</p>
<p><strong>[11:12]</strong> a land which Jehovah thy God is searching; continually `are&rsquo; the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the latter end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>[11:13]</strong> `And it hath been &ndash; if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[11:14]</strong> that I have given the rain of your land in its season &ndash; sprinkling and gathered &ndash; and thou hast gathered thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil,</p>
<p><strong>[11:15]</strong> and I have given herbs in thy field for thy cattle, and thou hast eaten, and been satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>[11:16]</strong> `Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be enticed, and ye have turned aside, and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them,</p>
<p><strong>[11:17]</strong> and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you, and He hath restrained the heavens, and there is no rain, and the ground doth not give her increase, and ye have perished hastily from off the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.</p>
<p><strong>[11:18]</strong> `And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and they have been for frontlets between your eyes;</p>
<p><strong>[11:19]</strong> and ye have taught them to your sons, by speaking of them in thy sitting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and in thy lying down, and in thy rising up,</p>
<p><strong>[11:20]</strong> and hast written them on the side-posts of thy house, and on thy gates,</p>
<p><strong>[11:21]</strong> so that your days are multiplied, and the days of your sons, on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to give to them, as the days of the heavens on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[11:22]</strong> `For, if ye diligently keep all this command which I am commanding you &ndash; to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him,</p>
<p><strong>[11:23]</strong> then hath Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you, and ye have possessed nations, greater and mightier than you;</p>
<p><strong>[11:24]</strong> every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is yours; from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Phrat, even unto the farther sea is your border;</p>
<p><strong>[11:25]</strong> no man doth station himself in your presence; your dread and your fear doth Jehovah your God put on the face of all the land on which ye tread, as He hath spoken to you.</p>
<p><strong>[11:26]</strong> `See, I am setting before you to-day a blessing and a reviling:</p>
<p><strong>[11:27]</strong> the blessing, when ye hearken unto the commands of Jehovah your God, which I am commanding you to-day;</p>
<p><strong>[11:28]</strong> and the reviling, if ye do not hearken unto the commands of Jehovah your God, and have turned aside out of the way which I am commanding you to-day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.</p>
<p><strong>[11:29]</strong> `And it hath been, when Jehovah thy God doth bring thee in unto the land whither thou art going in to possess it, that thou hast given the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the reviling on mount Ebal;</p>
<p><strong>[11:30]</strong> are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going in of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who is dwelling in the plain over-against Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?</p>
<p><strong>[11:31]</strong> for ye are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you; and ye have possessed it, and dwelt in it,</p>
<p><strong>[11:32]</strong> and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you to day.</p>
<p><strong>[12:1]</strong> <code>These </code>are&rsquo; the statutes and the judgments which ye observe to do in the land which Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath given to thee to possess it, all the days that ye are living on the ground:</p>
<p><strong>[12:2]</strong> ye do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which ye are dispossessing served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the heights, and under every green tree;</p>
<p><strong>[12:3]</strong> and ye have broken down their altars, and shivered their standing pillars, and their shrines ye burn with fire, and graven images of their gods ye cut down, and have destroyed their name out of that place.</p>
<p><strong>[12:4]</strong> `Ye do not do so to Jehovah your God;</p>
<p><strong>[12:5]</strong> but unto the place which Jehovah your God doth choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, to His tabernacle ye seek, and thou hast entered thither,</p>
<p><strong>[12:6]</strong> and hast brought in thither your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock;</p>
<p><strong>[12:7]</strong> and ye have eaten there before Jehovah your God, and have rejoiced in every putting forth of your hand, ye and your households, with which Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.</p>
<p><strong>[12:8]</strong> `Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day, each anything that is right in his own eyes,</p>

<p><strong>[12:10]</strong> and ye have passed over the Jordan, and have dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is causing you to inherit, and He hath given rest to you from all your enemies round about, and ye have dwelt confidently:</p>

<p><strong>[12:12]</strong> and ye have rejoiced before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your handmaids, and the Levite who `is&rsquo; within your gates, for he hath no part and inheritance with you.</p>

<p><strong>[15:3]</strong> of the stranger thou mayest exact, and that which is thine with thy brother doth thy hand release;</p>

<p><strong>[18:22]</strong> that which the prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, and the thing is not, and cometh not &ndash; it `is&rsquo; the word which Jehovah hath not spoken; in presumption hath the prophet spoken it; &ndash; thou art not afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>[19:1]</strong> `When Jehovah thy God doth cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, and thou hast succeeded them, and dwelt in their cities, and in their houses,</p>
<p><strong>[19:2]</strong> three cities thou dost separate for thee in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee to possess it.</p>
<p><strong>[19:3]</strong> Thou dost prepare for thee the way, and hast divided into three parts the border of thy land which Jehovah thy God doth cause thee to inherit, and it hath been for the fleeing thither of every man-slayer.</p>
<p><strong>[19:4]</strong> <code>And this </code>is&rsquo; the matter of the man-slayer who fleeth thither, and hath lived: He who smiteth his neighbour unknowingly, and is not hating him heretofore,</p>

<p><strong>[20:19]</strong> <code>When thou layest siege unto a city many days, to fight against it, to capture it, thou dost not destroy its trees to force an axe against them, for of them thou dost eat, and them thou dost not cut down -- for man's </code>is&rsquo; the tree of the field &ndash; to go in at thy presence in the siege.</p>
<p><strong>[20:20]</strong> Only, the tree, which thou knowest that it `is&rsquo; not a fruit-tree, it thou dost destroy, and hast cut down, and hast built a bulwark against the city which is making with thee war till thou hast subdued it.</p>

<p><strong>[28:60]</strong> `And He hath brought back on thee all the diseases of Egypt, of the presence of which thou hast been afraid, and they have cleaved to thee;</p>

<p><strong>[28:65]</strong> `And among those nations thou dost not rest, yea, there is no resting-place for the sole of thy foot, and Jehovah hath given to thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and grief of soul;</p>

<p><strong>[28:68]</strong> `And Jehovah hath brought thee back to Egypt with ships, by a way of which I said to thee, Thou dost not add any more to see it, and ye have sold yourselves there to thine enemies, for men-servants and for maid-servants, and there is no buyer.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[29:1]</strong> These `are&rsquo; the words of the covenant which Jehovah hath commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, apart from the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.</p>

<p><strong>[29:13]</strong> in order to establish thee to-day to Him for a people, and He Himself is thy God, as He hath spoken to thee, and as He hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[29:14]</strong> `And not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath;</p>
<p><strong>[29:15]</strong> but with him who is here with us, standing to-day before Jehovah our God, and with him who is not here with us to-day,</p>
<p><strong>[29:16]</strong> for ye have known how ye dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we passed by through the midst of the nations which ye have passed by;</p>

<p><strong>[29:18]</strong> lest there be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart is turning to-day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations, lest there be in you a root fruitful of gall and wormwood:</p>
<p><strong>[29:19]</strong> `And it hath been, in his hearing the words of this oath, and he hath blessed himself in his heart, saying, I have peace, though in the stubbornness of my heart I go on, in order to end the fulness with the thirst.</p>
<p><strong>[29:20]</strong> Jehovah is not willing to be propitious to him, for then doth the anger of Jehovah smoke, also His zeal, against that man, and lain down on him hath all the oath which is written in this book, and Jehovah hath blotted out his name from under the heavens,</p>
<p><strong>[29:21]</strong> and Jehovah hath separated him for evil, out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the oaths of the covenant which is written in this book of the law.</p>
<p><strong>[29:22]</strong> `And the latter generation of your sons who rise after you, and the stranger who cometh in from a land afar off, have said when they have seen the strokes of that land, and its sicknesses which Jehovah hath sent into it, &ndash;</p>

<p><strong>[29:24]</strong> yea, all the nations have said, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?</p>
<p><strong>[29:25]</strong> `And they have said, Because that they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah, God of their fathers, which He made with them in His bringing them out of the land of Egypt,</p>

<p><strong>[29:27]</strong> and the anger of Jehovah burneth against that land, to bring in on it all the reviling that is written in this book,</p>
<p><strong>[29:28]</strong> and Jehovah doth pluck them from off their ground in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath, and doth cast them unto another land, as `at&rsquo; this day.</p>

<p><strong>[31:5]</strong> And Jehovah hath given them before your face, and ye have done to them according to all the command which I have commanded you;</p>
<p><strong>[31:6]</strong> be strong and courageous, fear not, nor be terrified because of them, for Jehovah thy God `is&rsquo; He who is going with thee; He doth not fail thee nor forsake thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:7]</strong> And Moses calleth for Joshua, and saith unto him before the eyes of all Israel, `Be strong and courageous, for thou &ndash; thou dost go in with this people unto the land which Jehovah hath sworn to their fathers to give to them, and thou &ndash; thou dost cause them to inherit it;</p>

<p><strong>[31:9]</strong> And Moses writeth this law, and giveth it unto the priests (sons of Levi, those bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah), and unto all the elders of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[31:10]</strong> and Moses commandeth them, saying, `At the end of seven years, in the appointed time, the year of release, in the feast of booths,</p>
<p><strong>[31:11]</strong> in the coming in of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah in the place which He chooseth, thou dost proclaim this law before all Israel, in their ears.</p>
<p><strong>[31:12]</strong> <code>Assemble the people, the men, and the women, and the infants, and thy sojourner who </code>is&rsquo; within thy gates, so that they hear, and so that they learn, and have feared Jehovah your God, and observed to do all the words of this law;</p>

<p><strong>[31:14]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thy days have drawn near to die; call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of meeting, and I charge him;&rsquo; and Moses goeth &ndash; Joshua also &ndash; and they station themselves in the tent of meeting,</p>
<p><strong>[31:15]</strong> and Jehovah is seen in the tent, in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud standeth at the opening of the tent.</p>
<p><strong>[31:16]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thou art lying down with thy fathers, and this people hath risen, and gone a-whoring after the gods of the stranger of the land into the midst of which it hath entered, and forsaken Me, and broken My covenant which I made with it;</p>
<p><strong>[31:17]</strong> and Mine anger hath burned against it in that day, and I have forsaken them, and hidden My face from them, and it hath been for consumption, and many evils and distresses have found it, and it hath said in that day, Is it not because that my God is not in my midst &ndash; these evils have found me?</p>
<p><strong>[31:18]</strong> and I certainly hide My face in that day for all the evil which it hath done, for it hath turned unto other gods.</p>
<p><strong>[31:19]</strong> `And now, write for you this song, and teach it the sons of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song is to Me for a witness against the sons of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[31:20]</strong> and I bring them in unto the ground which I have sworn to their fathers &ndash; flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, and been fat, and have turned unto other gods, and they have served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant.</p>
<p><strong>[31:21]</strong> `And it hath been, when many evils and distresses do meet it, that this song hath testified to its face for a witness; for it is not forgotten out of the mouth of its seed, for I have known its imagining which it is doing to-day, before I bring them in unto the land of which I have sworn.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:22]</strong> And Moses writeth this song on that day, and doth teach it the sons of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[31:23]</strong> and He commandeth Joshua son of Nun, and saith, `Be strong and courageous, for thou dost bring in the sons of Israel unto the land which I have sworn to them, and I &ndash; I am with thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:24]</strong> And it cometh to pass, when Moses finisheth to write the words of this law on a book till their completion,</p>
<p><strong>[31:25]</strong> that Moses commandeth the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[31:26]</strong> `Take this Book of the Law, and thou hast set it on the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it hath been there against thee for a witness;</p>
<p><strong>[31:27]</strong> for I &ndash; I have known thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck; lo, in my being yet alive with you to-day, rebellious ye have been with Jehovah, and also surely after my death.</p>
<p><strong>[31:28]</strong> `Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your authorities, and I speak in their ears these words, and cause to testify against them the heavens and the earth,</p>
<p><strong>[31:29]</strong> for I have known that after my death ye do very corruptly, and have turned aside out of the way which I commanded you, and evil hath met you in the latter end of the days, because ye do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry with the work of your hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:30]</strong> And Moses speaketh in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, till their completion: &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[32:1]</strong> `Give ear, O heavens, and I speak; And thou dost hear, O earth, sayings of my mouth!</p>
<p><strong>[32:2]</strong> Drop as rain doth My doctrine; Flow as dew doth My sayings; As storms on the tender grass, And as showers on the herb,</p>
<p><strong>[32:3]</strong> For the Name of Jehovah I proclaim, Ascribe ye greatness to our God!</p>
<p><strong>[32:4]</strong> The Rock! &ndash; perfect <code>is' His work, For all His ways </code>are&rsquo; just; God of stedfastness, and without iniquity: Righteous and upright `is&rsquo; He.</p>
<p><strong>[32:5]</strong> It hath done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His sons&rsquo;, A generation perverse and crooked!</p>
<p><strong>[32:6]</strong> To Jehovah do ye act thus, O people foolish and not wise? Is not He thy father &ndash; thy possessor? He made thee, and doth establish thee.</p>
<p><strong>[32:7]</strong> Remember days of old &ndash; Understand the years of many generations &ndash; Ask thy father, and he doth tell thee; Thine elders, and they say to thee:</p>
<p><strong>[32:8]</strong> In the Most High causing nations to inherit, In His separating sons of Adam &ndash; He setteth up the borders of the peoples By the number of the sons of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[32:9]</strong> For Jehovah&rsquo;s portion <code>is' His people, Jacob </code>is&rsquo; the line of His inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>[32:10]</strong> He findeth him in a land &ndash; a desert, And in a void &ndash; a howling wilderness, He turneth him round &ndash; He causeth him to understand &ndash; He keepeth him as the apple of His eye.</p>
<p><strong>[32:11]</strong> As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings &ndash; taketh them, Beareth them on its pinions; &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[32:12]</strong> Jehovah alone doth lead him, And there is no strange god with him.</p>
<p><strong>[32:13]</strong> He maketh him ride on high places of earth, And he eateth increase of the fields, And He maketh him suck honey from a rock, And oil out of the flint of a rock;</p>
<p><strong>[32:14]</strong> Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, and rams, sons of Bashan, And he-goats, with fat of kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou dost drink wine!</p>
<p><strong>[32:15]</strong> And Jeshurun waxeth fat, and doth kick: Thou hast been fat &ndash; thou hast been thick, Thou hast been covered. And he leaveth God who made him, And dishonoureth the Rock of his salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[32:16]</strong> They make Him zealous with strangers, With abominations they make Him angry.</p>
<p><strong>[32:17]</strong> They sacrifice to demons &ndash; no god! Gods they have not known &ndash; New ones &ndash; from the vicinity they came; Not feared them have your fathers!</p>
<p><strong>[32:18]</strong> The Rock that begat thee thou forgettest, And neglectest God who formeth thee.</p>
<p><strong>[32:19]</strong> And Jehovah seeth and despiseth &ndash; For the provocation of His sons and His daughters.</p>
<p><strong>[32:20]</strong> And He saith: I hide My face from them, I see what <code>is' their latter end; For a froward generation </code>are&rsquo; they, Sons in whom is no stedfastness.</p>
<p><strong>[32:21]</strong> They have made Me zealous by <code>no-god,' They made Me angry by their vanities; And I make them zealous by </code>no-people,&rsquo; By a foolish nation I make them angry.</p>
<p><strong>[32:22]</strong> For a fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, And it burneth unto Sheol &ndash; the lowest, And consumeth earth and its increase, And setteth on fire foundations of mountains.</p>
<p><strong>[32:23]</strong> I gather upon them evils, Mine arrows I consume upon them.</p>
<p><strong>[32:24]</strong> Exhausted by famine, And consumed by heat, and bitter destruction. And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With poison of fearful things of the dust.</p>
<p><strong>[32:25]</strong> Without bereave doth the sword, And at the inner-chambers &ndash; fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair.</p>
<p><strong>[32:26]</strong> I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance to cease from man;</p>
<p><strong>[32:27]</strong> If not &ndash; the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their adversaries know &ndash; Lest they say, Our hand is high, And Jehovah hath not wrought all this.</p>
<p><strong>[32:28]</strong> For a nation lost to counsels `are&rsquo; they, And there is no understanding in them.</p>
<p><strong>[32:29]</strong> If they were wise &ndash; They deal wisely `with&rsquo; this; They attend to their latter end:</p>
<p><strong>[32:30]</strong> How doth one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to flee! If not &ndash; that their rock hath sold them, And Jehovah hath shut them up?</p>
<p><strong>[32:31]</strong> For not as our Rock <code>is' their rock, (And our enemies </code>are&rsquo; judges!)</p>
<p><strong>[32:32]</strong> For of the vine of Sodom their vine <code>is', And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes </code>are&rsquo; grapes of gall &ndash; They have bitter clusters;</p>
<p><strong>[32:33]</strong> The poison of dragons `is&rsquo; their wine And the fierce venom of asps.</p>
<p><strong>[32:34]</strong> Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?</p>
<p><strong>[32:35]</strong> Mine `are&rsquo; vengeance and recompense, At the due time &ndash; doth their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And haste do things prepared for them.</p>
<p><strong>[32:36]</strong> For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants doth repent Himself. For He seeth &ndash; the going away of power, And none is restrained and left.</p>
<p><strong>[32:37]</strong> And He hath said, Where `are&rsquo; their gods &ndash; The rock in which they trusted;</p>
<p><strong>[32:38]</strong> Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be for you a hiding-place!</p>
<p><strong>[32:39]</strong> See ye, now, that I &ndash; I `am&rsquo; He, And there is no god with Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,</p>
<p><strong>[32:40]</strong> For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I live &ndash; to the age!</p>
<p><strong>[32:41]</strong> If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My hand doth lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine adversaries, And to those hating Me &ndash; I repay!</p>
<p><strong>[32:42]</strong> I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive, From the head of the freemen of the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>[32:43]</strong> Sing ye nations &ndash; `with&rsquo; his people, For the blood of His servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His adversaries, And hath pardoned His land &ndash; His people.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:44]</strong> And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;</p>
<p><strong>[32:45]</strong> and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[32:46]</strong> and saith unto them, `Set your heart to all the words which I am testifying against you to-day, that ye command your sons to observe to do all the words of this law,</p>
<p><strong>[32:47]</strong> for it <code>is' not a vain thing for you, for it </code>is&rsquo; your life, and by this thing ye prolong days on the ground whither ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:48]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in this self-same day, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[32:49]</strong> <code>Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which </code>is&rsquo; in the land of Moab, which `is&rsquo; on the front of Jericho, and see the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession;</p>
<p><strong>[32:50]</strong> and die in the mount whither thou art going up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath died in the mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:</p>
<p><strong>[32:51]</strong> `Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh, the wilderness of Zin &ndash; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the sons of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[32:52]</strong> but over-against thou seest the land, and thither thou dost not go in, unto the land which I am giving to the sons of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[33:1]</strong> And this <code>is' the blessing </code>with&rsquo; which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death,</p>
<p><strong>[33:2]</strong> and he saith: &ndash; <code>Jehovah from Sinai hath come, And hath risen from Seir for them; He hath shone from mount Paran, And hath come </code>with&rsquo; myriads of holy ones; At His right hand `are&rsquo; springs for them.</p>
<p><strong>[33:3]</strong> Also He <code>is' loving the peoples; All His holy ones </code>are&rsquo; in thy hand, And they &ndash; they sat down at thy foot, `Each&rsquo; He lifteth up at thy words.</p>
<p><strong>[33:4]</strong> A law hath Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[33:5]</strong> And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people gathering together, The tribes of Israel!</p>
<p><strong>[33:6]</strong> Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number.</p>
<p><strong>[33:7]</strong> And this `is&rsquo; for Judah; and he saith: &ndash; Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And unto his people do Thou bring him in; His hand hath striven for him, And an help from his adversaries art Thou.</p>
<p><strong>[33:8]</strong> And of Levi he said: &ndash; Thy Thummim and thy Urim `are&rsquo; for thy pious one, Whom Thou hast tried in Massah, Thou dost strive with Him at the waters of Meribah;</p>
<p><strong>[33:9]</strong> Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen him; And his brethren he hath not discerned, And his sons he hath not known; For they have observed Thy saying, And Thy covenant they keep.</p>
<p><strong>[33:10]</strong> They teach Thy judgments to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel; They put perfume in Thy nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine altar.</p>
<p><strong>[33:11]</strong> Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And the work of his hands Thou acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of those hating him &ndash; that they rise not!</p>
<p><strong>[33:12]</strong> Of Benjamin he said: &ndash; The beloved of Jehovah doth tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day; Yea, between his shoulders He doth tabernacle.</p>
<p><strong>[33:13]</strong> And of Joseph he said: &ndash; Blessed of Jehovah `is&rsquo; his land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the deep crouching beneath,</p>
<p><strong>[33:14]</strong> And by precious things &ndash; fruits of the sun, And by precious things &ndash; cast forth by the moons,</p>
<p><strong>[33:15]</strong> And by chief things &ndash; of the ancient mountains, And by precious things &ndash; of the age-during heights,</p>
<p><strong>[33:16]</strong> And by precious things &ndash; of earth and its fulness, And the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, &ndash; Let it come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is separate from his brethren.</p>
<p><strong>[33:17]</strong> His honour <code>is' a firstling of his ox, And his horns </code>are&rsquo; horns of a reem; By them peoples he doth push together To the ends of earth; And they <code>are' the myriads of Ephraim, And they </code>are&rsquo; the thousands of Manasseh.</p>
<p><strong>[33:18]</strong> And of Zebulun he said: &ndash; Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy going out, And, O Issachar, in thy tents;</p>
<p><strong>[33:19]</strong> Peoples `to&rsquo; the mountain they call, There they sacrifice righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck, And hidden things hidden in the sand.</p>
<p><strong>[33:20]</strong> And of Gad he said: &ndash; Blessed of the Enlarger `is&rsquo; Gad, As a lioness he doth tabernacle, And hath torn the arm &ndash; also the crown!</p>
<p><strong>[33:21]</strong> And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he cometh `with&rsquo; the heads of the people; The righteousness of Jehovah he hath done, And His judgments with Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[33:22]</strong> And of Dan he said: &ndash; Dan `is&rsquo; a lion&rsquo;s whelp; he doth leap from Bashan.</p>
<p><strong>[33:23]</strong> And of Naphtali he said: &ndash; O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, West and south possess thou.</p>
<p><strong>[33:24]</strong> And of Asher he said: &ndash; Blessed with sons `is&rsquo; Asher, Let him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot.</p>
<p><strong>[33:25]</strong> Iron and brass `are&rsquo; thy shoes, And as thy days &ndash; thy strength.</p>
<p><strong>[33:26]</strong> There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens in thy help, And in His excellency the skies.</p>
<p><strong>[33:27]</strong> A habitation <code>is' the eternal God, And beneath </code>are&rsquo; arms age-during. And He casteth out from thy presence the enemy, and saith, `Destroy!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[33:28]</strong> And Israel doth tabernacle <code>in' confidence alone; The eye of Jacob </code>is&rsquo; unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew.</p>
<p><strong>[33:29]</strong> O thy happiness, O Israel! who is like thee? A people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And He who `is&rsquo; the sword of thine excellency: And thine enemies are subdued for thee, And thou on their high places dost tread.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[34:1]</strong> And Moses goeth up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which `is&rsquo; on the front of Jericho, and Jehovah sheweth him all the land &ndash; Gilead unto Dan,</p>
<p><strong>[34:2]</strong> and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the further sea,</p>
<p><strong>[34:3]</strong> and the south, and the circuit of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, unto Zoar.</p>
<p><strong>[34:4]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto him, <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed I give it; I have caused thee to see with thine eyes, and thither thou dost not pass over.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[34:5]</strong> And Moses, servant of the Lord, dieth there, in the land of Moab, according to the command of Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[34:6]</strong> and He burieth him in a valley in the land of Moab, over-against Beth-Peor, and no man hath known his burying place unto this day.</p>
<p><strong>[34:7]</strong> And Moses `is&rsquo; a son of a hundred and twenty years when he dieth; his eye hath not become dim, nor hath his moisture fled.</p>
<p><strong>[34:8]</strong> And the sons of Israel bewail Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping `and&rsquo; mourning for Moses are completed.</p>
<p><strong>[34:9]</strong> And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him, and the sons of Israel hearken unto him, and do as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[34:10]</strong> And there hath not arisen a prophet any more in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah hath known face unto face,</p>
<p><strong>[34:11]</strong> in reference to all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
<p><strong>[34:12]</strong> and in reference to all the strong hand, and to all the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.</p>
