    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> For giving to simple ones &ndash; prudence, To a youth &ndash; knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> Fear of Jehovah `is&rsquo; a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> For a graceful wreath `are&rsquo; they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> We swallow them as Sheol &ndash; alive, And whole &ndash; as those going down `to&rsquo; the pit,</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses `with&rsquo; spoil,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is &ndash; to all of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> So `are&rsquo; the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> `Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.</p>
<p><strong>[1:26]</strong> I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,</p>
<p><strong>[1:27]</strong> When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.</p>
<p><strong>[1:28]</strong> Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.</p>
<p><strong>[1:29]</strong> Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.</p>
<p><strong>[1:30]</strong> They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,</p>
<p><strong>[1:31]</strong> And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.</p>
<p><strong>[1:32]</strong> For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.</p>
<p><strong>[1:33]</strong> And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And `is&rsquo; quiet from fear of evil!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness &ndash; every good path.</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> Whose paths `are&rsquo; crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> And filled are thy barns <code>with' plenty, And </code>with&rsquo; new wine thy presses break forth.</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> O the happiness of a man <code>who' hath found wisdom, And of a man </code>who&rsquo; bringeth forth understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> For better `is&rsquo; her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold &ndash; her increase.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> Precious she `is&rsquo; above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> Length of days <code>is' in her right hand, In her left </code>are&rsquo; wealth and honour.</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> Her ways <code>are' ways of pleasantness, And all her paths </code>are&rsquo; peace.</p>
<p><strong>[3:18]</strong> A tree of life she <code>is' to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her </code>is&rsquo; happy.</p>
<p><strong>[3:19]</strong> Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[3:20]</strong> By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.</p>
<p><strong>[3:21]</strong> My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,</p>
<p><strong>[3:22]</strong> And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p><strong>[3:23]</strong> Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.</p>
<p><strong>[3:24]</strong> If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.</p>
<p><strong>[3:25]</strong> Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.</p>
<p><strong>[3:26]</strong> For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.</p>
<p><strong>[3:27]</strong> Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand <code>is' toward God to do </code>it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>[3:28]</strong> Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,&rsquo; And substance with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[3:29]</strong> Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[3:30]</strong> Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.</p>
<p><strong>[3:31]</strong> Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.</p>
<p><strong>[3:32]</strong> For an abomination to Jehovah <code>is' the perverted, And with the upright </code>is&rsquo; His secret counsel.</p>
<p><strong>[3:33]</strong> The curse of Jehovah `is&rsquo; in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.</p>
<p><strong>[3:34]</strong> If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.</p>
<p><strong>[3:35]</strong> Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> For, a son I have been to my father &ndash; tender, And an only one before my mother.</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> The first thing `is&rsquo; wisdom &ndash; get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life `are&rsquo; multiplied to thee.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she `is&rsquo; thy life.</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not `some&rsquo; to stumble.</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> And the path of the righteous `is&rsquo; as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> The way of the wicked `is&rsquo; as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> For life they `are&rsquo; to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.</p>
<p><strong>[4:23]</strong> Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it `are&rsquo; the outgoings of life.</p>
<p><strong>[4:24]</strong> Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,</p>
<p><strong>[4:25]</strong> Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p><strong>[4:26]</strong> Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways `are&rsquo; established.</p>
<p><strong>[4:27]</strong> Incline not `to&rsquo; the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!</p>
<p><strong>[5:1]</strong> My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,</p>
<p><strong>[5:2]</strong> To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.</p>
<p><strong>[5:3]</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil `is&rsquo; her mouth,</p>
<p><strong>[5:4]</strong> And her latter end <code>is' bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword </code>with&rsquo; mouths.</p>
<p><strong>[5:5]</strong> Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.</p>
<p><strong>[5:6]</strong> The path of life &ndash; lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths &ndash; thou knowest not.</p>
<p><strong>[5:7]</strong> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[5:8]</strong> Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,</p>
<p><strong>[5:9]</strong> Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,</p>
<p><strong>[5:10]</strong> Lest strangers be filled `with&rsquo; thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,</p>
<p><strong>[5:11]</strong> And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,</p>
<p><strong>[5:12]</strong> And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,</p>
<p><strong>[5:13]</strong> And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.</p>
<p><strong>[5:14]</strong> As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.</p>
<p><strong>[5:15]</strong> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.</p>
<p><strong>[5:16]</strong> Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.</p>
<p><strong>[5:17]</strong> Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[5:18]</strong> Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,</p>
<p><strong>[5:19]</strong> A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.</p>
<p><strong>[5:20]</strong> And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?</p>
<p><strong>[5:21]</strong> For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.</p>
<p><strong>[5:22]</strong> His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.</p>
<p><strong>[5:23]</strong> He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!</p>
<p><strong>[6:1]</strong> My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,</p>
<p><strong>[6:2]</strong> Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,</p>
<p><strong>[6:3]</strong> Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,</p>
<p><strong>[6:4]</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,</p>
<p><strong>[6:5]</strong> Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.</p>
<p><strong>[6:6]</strong> Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;</p>
<p><strong>[6:7]</strong> Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,</p>
<p><strong>[6:8]</strong> She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.</p>
<p><strong>[6:9]</strong> Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?</p>
<p><strong>[6:10]</strong> A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,</p>
<p><strong>[6:11]</strong> And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p><strong>[6:12]</strong> A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking `with&rsquo; perverseness of mouth,</p>
<p><strong>[6:13]</strong> Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,</p>
<p><strong>[6:14]</strong> Frowardness `is&rsquo; in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.</p>
<p><strong>[6:15]</strong> Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken &ndash; and no healing.</p>
<p><strong>[6:16]</strong> These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven `are&rsquo; abominations to His soul.</p>
<p><strong>[6:17]</strong> Eyes high &ndash; tongues false &ndash; And hands shedding innocent blood &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[6:18]</strong> A heart devising thoughts of vanity &ndash; Feet hasting to run to evil &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[6:19]</strong> A false witness `who&rsquo; doth breathe out lies &ndash; And one sending forth contentions between brethren.</p>
<p><strong>[6:20]</strong> Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.</p>
<p><strong>[6:21]</strong> Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.</p>
<p><strong>[6:22]</strong> In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked &ndash; it talketh `with&rsquo; thee.</p>
<p><strong>[6:23]</strong> For a lamp <code>is' the command, And the law a light, And a way of life </code>are&rsquo; reproofs of instruction,</p>
<p><strong>[6:24]</strong> To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p><strong>[6:25]</strong> Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p><strong>[6:26]</strong> For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.</p>
<p><strong>[6:27]</strong> Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?</p>
<p><strong>[6:28]</strong> Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?</p>
<p><strong>[6:29]</strong> So `is&rsquo; he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.</p>
<p><strong>[6:30]</strong> They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,</p>
<p><strong>[6:31]</strong> And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.</p>
<p><strong>[6:32]</strong> He who committeth adultery `with&rsquo; a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.</p>
<p><strong>[6:33]</strong> A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,</p>
<p><strong>[6:34]</strong> For jealousy `is&rsquo; the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>[6:35]</strong> He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!</p>
<p><strong>[7:1]</strong> My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[7:2]</strong> Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye.</p>
<p><strong>[7:3]</strong> Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart.</p>
<p><strong>[7:4]</strong> Say to wisdom, <code>My sister Thou </code>art&rsquo;.&rsquo; And cry to understanding, `Kinswoman!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[7:5]</strong> To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.</p>
<p><strong>[7:6]</strong> For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,</p>
<p><strong>[7:7]</strong> And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,</p>
<p><strong>[7:8]</strong> Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way `to&rsquo; her house he doth step,</p>
<p><strong>[7:9]</strong> In the twilight &ndash; in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.</p>
<p><strong>[7:10]</strong> And, lo, a woman to meet him &ndash; (A harlot&rsquo;s dress, and watchful of heart,</p>
<p><strong>[7:11]</strong> Noisy she `is&rsquo;, and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.</p>
<p><strong>[7:12]</strong> Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[7:13]</strong> And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,</p>
<p><strong>[7:14]</strong> <code>Sacrifices of peace-offerings </code>are&rsquo; by me, To-day I have completed my vows.</p>
<p><strong>[7:15]</strong> Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.</p>
<p><strong>[7:16]</strong> `With&rsquo; ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works &ndash; cotton of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[7:17]</strong> I sprinkled my bed &ndash; myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p><strong>[7:18]</strong> Come, we are filled `with&rsquo; loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.</p>
<p><strong>[7:19]</strong> For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey.</p>
<p><strong>[7:20]</strong> A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[7:21]</strong> She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.</p>
<p><strong>[7:22]</strong> He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,</p>
<p><strong>[7:23]</strong> Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it `is&rsquo; for its life.</p>
<p><strong>[7:24]</strong> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[7:25]</strong> Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,</p>
<p><strong>[7:26]</strong> For many <code>are' the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty </code>are&rsquo; all her slain ones.</p>
<p><strong>[7:27]</strong> The ways of Sheol &ndash; her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!</p>
<p><strong>[8:1]</strong> Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?</p>
<p><strong>[8:2]</strong> At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,</p>
<p><strong>[8:3]</strong> At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,</p>
<p><strong>[8:4]</strong> <code>Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice </code>is&rsquo; unto the sons of men.</p>
<p><strong>[8:5]</strong> Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,</p>
<p><strong>[8:6]</strong> Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips `is&rsquo; uprightness.</p>
<p><strong>[8:7]</strong> For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips `is&rsquo; wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>[8:8]</strong> In righteousness `are&rsquo; all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.</p>
<p><strong>[8:9]</strong> All of them `are&rsquo; plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[8:10]</strong> Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p><strong>[8:11]</strong> For better `is&rsquo; wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.</p>
<p><strong>[8:12]</strong> I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.</p>
<p><strong>[8:13]</strong> The fear of Jehovah `is&rsquo; to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.</p>
<p><strong>[8:14]</strong> Mine <code>is' counsel and substance, I </code>am&rsquo; understanding, I have might.</p>
<p><strong>[8:15]</strong> By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,</p>
<p><strong>[8:16]</strong> By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[8:17]</strong> I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.</p>
<p><strong>[8:18]</strong> Wealth and honour `are&rsquo; with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[8:19]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.</p>
<p><strong>[8:20]</strong> In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,</p>
<p><strong>[8:21]</strong> To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.</p>
<p><strong>[8:22]</strong> Jehovah possessed me &ndash; the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.</p>
<p><strong>[8:23]</strong> From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[8:24]</strong> In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy `with&rsquo; waters,</p>
<p><strong>[8:25]</strong> Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.</p>
<p><strong>[8:26]</strong> While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>[8:27]</strong> In His preparing the heavens I `am&rsquo; there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,</p>
<p><strong>[8:28]</strong> In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,</p>
<p><strong>[8:29]</strong> In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,</p>
<p><strong>[8:30]</strong> Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight &ndash; day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,</p>
<p><strong>[8:31]</strong> Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights `are&rsquo; with the sons of men.</p>
<p><strong>[8:32]</strong> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.</p>
<p><strong>[8:33]</strong> Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.</p>
<p><strong>[8:34]</strong> O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.</p>
<p><strong>[8:35]</strong> For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[8:36]</strong> And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!</p>
<p><strong>[9:1]</strong> Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars &ndash; seven.</p>
<p><strong>[9:2]</strong> She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.</p>
<p><strong>[9:3]</strong> She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:</p>
<p><strong>[9:4]</strong> <code>Who </code>is&rsquo; simple? let him turn aside hither.&rsquo; Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,</p>
<p><strong>[9:5]</strong> `Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled.</p>
<p><strong>[9:6]</strong> Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[9:7]</strong> The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it &ndash; shame, And a reprover of the wicked &ndash; his blemish.</p>
<p><strong>[9:8]</strong> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee.</p>
<p><strong>[9:9]</strong> Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.</p>
<p><strong>[9:10]</strong> The commencement of wisdom <code>is' the fear of Jehovah, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones </code>is&rsquo; understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[9:11]</strong> For by me do thy days multiply, And added to thee are years of life.</p>
<p><strong>[9:12]</strong> If thou hast been wise, thou hast been wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned &ndash; thyself bearest `it&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>[9:13]</strong> A foolish woman `is&rsquo; noisy, Simple, and hath not known what.</p>
<p><strong>[9:14]</strong> And she hath sat at the opening of her house, On a throne &ndash; the high places of the city,</p>
<p><strong>[9:15]</strong> To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight `on&rsquo; their paths.</p>
<p><strong>[9:16]</strong> <code>Who </code>is&rsquo; simple? let him turn aside hither.&rsquo; And whoso lacketh heart &ndash; she said to him,</p>
<p><strong>[9:17]</strong> `Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:18]</strong> And he hath not known that Rephaim `are&rsquo; there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!</p>
<p><strong>[10:1]</strong> Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son `is&rsquo; an affliction to his mother.</p>
<p><strong>[10:2]</strong> Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p><strong>[10:3]</strong> Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.</p>
<p><strong>[10:4]</strong> Poor `is&rsquo; he who is working &ndash; a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p><strong>[10:5]</strong> Whoso is gathering in summer <code>is' a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest </code>is&rsquo; a son causing shame.</p>
<p><strong>[10:6]</strong> Blessings `are&rsquo; for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.</p>
<p><strong>[10:7]</strong> The remembrance of the righteous `is&rsquo; for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.</p>
<p><strong>[10:8]</strong> The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.</p>
<p><strong>[10:9]</strong> Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.</p>
<p><strong>[10:10]</strong> Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.</p>
<p><strong>[10:11]</strong> A fountain of life `is&rsquo; the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.</p>
<p><strong>[10:12]</strong> Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.</p>
<p><strong>[10:13]</strong> In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod `is&rsquo; for the back of him who is lacking understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[10:14]</strong> The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool `is&rsquo; near ruin.</p>
<p><strong>[10:15]</strong> The wealth of the rich <code>is' his strong city, The ruin of the poor </code>is&rsquo; their poverty.</p>
<p><strong>[10:16]</strong> The wage of the righteous `is&rsquo; for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.</p>
<p><strong>[10:17]</strong> A traveller to life `is&rsquo; he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.</p>
<p><strong>[10:18]</strong> Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[10:19]</strong> In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips `is&rsquo; wise.</p>
<p><strong>[10:20]</strong> The tongue of the righteous `is&rsquo; chosen silver, The heart of the wicked &ndash; as a little thing.</p>
<p><strong>[10:21]</strong> The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.</p>
<p><strong>[10:22]</strong> The blessing of Jehovah &ndash; it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.</p>
<p><strong>[10:23]</strong> To execute inventions `is&rsquo; as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[10:24]</strong> The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.</p>
<p><strong>[10:25]</strong> As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.</p>
<p><strong>[10:26]</strong> As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So `is&rsquo; the slothful to those sending him.</p>
<p><strong>[10:27]</strong> The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.</p>
<p><strong>[10:28]</strong> The hope of the righteous `is&rsquo; joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.</p>
<p><strong>[10:29]</strong> The way of Jehovah `is&rsquo; strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><strong>[10:30]</strong> The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[10:31]</strong> The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.</p>
<p><strong>[10:32]</strong> The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!</p>
<p><strong>[11:1]</strong> Balances of deceit <code>are' an abomination to Jehovah, And a perfect weight </code>is&rsquo; His delight.</p>
<p><strong>[11:2]</strong> Pride hath come, and shame cometh, And with the lowly `is&rsquo; wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>[11:3]</strong> The integrity of the upright leadeth them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.</p>
<p><strong>[11:4]</strong> Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath, And righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p><strong>[11:5]</strong> The righteousness of the perfect maketh right his way, And by his wickedness doth the wicked fall.</p>
<p><strong>[11:6]</strong> The righteousness of the upright delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.</p>
<p><strong>[11:7]</strong> In the death of a wicked man, hope perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous hath been lost.</p>
<p><strong>[11:8]</strong> The righteous from distress is drawn out, And the wicked goeth in instead of him.</p>
<p><strong>[11:9]</strong> With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.</p>
<p><strong>[11:10]</strong> In the good of the righteous a city exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked `is&rsquo; singing.</p>
<p><strong>[11:11]</strong> By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.</p>
<p><strong>[11:12]</strong> Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.</p>
<p><strong>[11:13]</strong> A busybody is revealing secret counsel, And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter.</p>
<p><strong>[11:14]</strong> Without counsels do a people fall, And deliverance `is&rsquo; in a multitude of counsellors.</p>
<p><strong>[11:15]</strong> Evil <code>one' suffereth when he hath been surety </code>for&rsquo; a stranger, And whoso is hating suretyship is confident.</p>
<p><strong>[11:16]</strong> A gracious woman retaineth honour, And terrible `men&rsquo; retain riches.</p>
<p><strong>[11:17]</strong> A kind man is rewarding his own soul, And the fierce is troubling his own flesh.</p>
<p><strong>[11:18]</strong> The wicked is getting a lying wage, And whoso is sowing righteousness &ndash; a true reward.</p>
<p><strong>[11:19]</strong> Rightly `is&rsquo; righteousness for life, And whoso is pursuing evil &ndash; for his own death.</p>
<p><strong>[11:20]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah <code>are' the perverse of heart, And the perfect of the way </code>are&rsquo; His delight.</p>
<p><strong>[11:21]</strong> Hand to hand, the wicked is not acquitted, And the seed of the righteous hath escaped.</p>
<p><strong>[11:22]</strong> A ring of gold in the nose of a sow &ndash; A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>[11:23]</strong> The desire of the righteous <code>is' only good, The hope of the wicked </code>is&rsquo; transgression.</p>
<p><strong>[11:24]</strong> There is who is scattering, and yet is increased, And who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want.</p>
<p><strong>[11:25]</strong> A liberal soul is made fat, And whoso is watering, he also is watered.</p>
<p><strong>[11:26]</strong> Whoso is withholding corn, the people execrate him, And a blessing `is&rsquo; for the head of him who is selling.</p>
<p><strong>[11:27]</strong> Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh a pleasing thing, And whoso is seeking evil &ndash; it meeteth him.</p>
<p><strong>[11:28]</strong> Whoso is confident in his wealth he falleth, And as a leaf, the righteous flourish.</p>
<p><strong>[11:29]</strong> Whoso is troubling his own house inheriteth wind, And a servant `is&rsquo; the fool to the wise of heart.</p>
<p><strong>[11:30]</strong> The fruit of the righteous <code>is' a tree of life, And whoso is taking souls </code>is&rsquo; wise.</p>
<p><strong>[11:31]</strong> Lo, the righteous in the earth is recompensed, Surely also the wicked and the sinner!</p>
<p><strong>[12:1]</strong> Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof `is&rsquo; brutish.</p>
<p><strong>[12:2]</strong> The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:3]</strong> A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.</p>
<p><strong>[12:4]</strong> A virtuous woman <code>is' a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones </code>is&rsquo; one causing shame.</p>
<p><strong>[12:5]</strong> The thoughts of the righteous `are&rsquo; justice, The counsels of the wicked &ndash; deceit.</p>
<p><strong>[12:6]</strong> The words of the wicked <code>are': </code>Lay wait for blood,&rsquo; And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.</p>
<p><strong>[12:7]</strong> Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:8]</strong> According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart becometh despised.</p>
<p><strong>[12:9]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; the lightly esteemed who hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.</p>
<p><strong>[12:10]</strong> The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked `are&rsquo; cruel.</p>
<p><strong>[12:11]</strong> Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied `with&rsquo; bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,</p>
<p><strong>[12:12]</strong> The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:13]</strong> In transgression of the lips `is&rsquo; the snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.</p>
<p><strong>[12:14]</strong> From the fruit of the mouth <code>is' one satisfied </code>with&rsquo; good, And the deed of man&rsquo;s hands returneth to him.</p>
<p><strong>[12:15]</strong> The way of a fool <code>is' right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel </code>is&rsquo; wise.</p>
<p><strong>[12:16]</strong> The fool &ndash; in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.</p>
<p><strong>[12:17]</strong> Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness &ndash; deceit.</p>
<p><strong>[12:18]</strong> A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.</p>
<p><strong>[12:19]</strong> The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment &ndash; a tongue of falsehood.</p>
<p><strong>[12:20]</strong> Deceit <code>is' in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace </code>is&rsquo; joy.</p>
<p><strong>[12:21]</strong> No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.</p>
<p><strong>[12:22]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah <code>are' lying lips, And stedfast doers </code>are&rsquo; his delight.</p>
<p><strong>[12:23]</strong> A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.</p>
<p><strong>[12:24]</strong> The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness becometh tributary.</p>
<p><strong>[12:25]</strong> Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word maketh him glad.</p>
<p><strong>[12:26]</strong> The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.</p>
<p><strong>[12:27]</strong> The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.</p>
<p><strong>[12:28]</strong> In the path of righteousness <code>is' life, And in the way of </code>that&rsquo; path `is&rsquo; no death!</p>
<p><strong>[13:1]</strong> A wise son &ndash; the instruction of a father, And a scorner &ndash; he hath not heard rebuke.</p>
<p><strong>[13:2]</strong> From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous &ndash; violence.</p>
<p><strong>[13:3]</strong> Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips &ndash; ruin to him!</p>
<p><strong>[13:4]</strong> The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.</p>
<p><strong>[13:5]</strong> A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.</p>
<p><strong>[13:6]</strong> Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.</p>
<p><strong>[13:7]</strong> There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth `is&rsquo; abundant.</p>
<p><strong>[13:8]</strong> The ransom of a man&rsquo;s life `are&rsquo; his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.</p>
<p><strong>[13:9]</strong> The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.</p>
<p><strong>[13:10]</strong> A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled `is&rsquo; wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>[13:11]</strong> Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.</p>
<p><strong>[13:12]</strong> Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life `is&rsquo; the coming desire.</p>
<p><strong>[13:13]</strong> Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.</p>
<p><strong>[13:14]</strong> The law of the wise `is&rsquo; a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.</p>
<p><strong>[13:15]</strong> Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous `is&rsquo; hard.</p>
<p><strong>[13:16]</strong> Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.</p>
<p><strong>[13:17]</strong> A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.</p>
<p><strong>[13:18]</strong> Whoso is refusing instruction &ndash; poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.</p>
<p><strong>[13:19]</strong> A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools `is&rsquo;: Turn from evil.</p>
<p><strong>[13:20]</strong> Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.</p>
<p><strong>[13:21]</strong> Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.</p>
<p><strong>[13:22]</strong> A good man causeth sons&rsquo; sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous `is&rsquo; the sinner&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p><strong>[13:23]</strong> Abundance of food &ndash; the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.</p>
<p><strong>[13:24]</strong> Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.</p>
<p><strong>[13:25]</strong> The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!</p>
<p><strong>[14:1]</strong> Every wise woman hath builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.</p>
<p><strong>[14:2]</strong> Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah, And the perverted `in&rsquo; his ways is despising Him.</p>
<p><strong>[14:3]</strong> In the mouth of a fool `is&rsquo; a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.</p>
<p><strong>[14:4]</strong> Without oxen a stall <code>is' clean, And great </code>is&rsquo; the increase by the power of the ox.</p>
<p><strong>[14:5]</strong> A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.</p>
<p><strong>[14:6]</strong> A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent `is&rsquo; easy.</p>
<p><strong>[14:7]</strong> Go from before a foolish man, Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[14:8]</strong> The wisdom of the prudent <code>is' to understand his way, And the folly of fools </code>is&rsquo; deceit.</p>
<p><strong>[14:9]</strong> Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright &ndash; a pleasing thing.</p>
<p><strong>[14:10]</strong> The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.</p>
<p><strong>[14:11]</strong> The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.</p>
<p><strong>[14:12]</strong> There is a way &ndash; right before a man, And its latter end `are&rsquo; ways of death.</p>
<p><strong>[14:13]</strong> Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy `is&rsquo; affliction.</p>
<p><strong>[14:14]</strong> From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man &ndash; from his fruits.</p>
<p><strong>[14:15]</strong> The simple giveth credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.</p>
<p><strong>[14:16]</strong> The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.</p>
<p><strong>[14:17]</strong> Whoso is short of temper doth folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>
<p><strong>[14:18]</strong> The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned `with&rsquo; knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[14:19]</strong> The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>
<p><strong>[14:20]</strong> Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich `are&rsquo; many.</p>
<p><strong>[14:21]</strong> Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.</p>
<p><strong>[14:22]</strong> Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth `are&rsquo; to those devising good,</p>
<p><strong>[14:23]</strong> In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips `is&rsquo; only to want.</p>
<p><strong>[14:24]</strong> The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools `is&rsquo; folly.</p>
<p><strong>[14:25]</strong> A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.</p>
<p><strong>[14:26]</strong> In the fear of Jehovah `is&rsquo; strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.</p>
<p><strong>[14:27]</strong> The fear of Jehovah `is&rsquo; a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.</p>
<p><strong>[14:28]</strong> In the multitude of a people `is&rsquo; the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.</p>
<p><strong>[14:29]</strong> Whoso is slow to anger `is&rsquo; of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.</p>
<p><strong>[14:30]</strong> A healed heart <code>is' life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones </code>is&rsquo; envy.</p>
<p><strong>[14:31]</strong> An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.</p>
<p><strong>[14:32]</strong> In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death `is&rsquo; the righteous.</p>
<p><strong>[14:33]</strong> In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.</p>
<p><strong>[14:34]</strong> Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples `is&rsquo; a sin-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[14:35]</strong> The favour of a king `is&rsquo; to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!</p>
<p><strong>[15:1]</strong> A soft answer turneth back fury, And a grievous word raiseth up anger.</p>
<p><strong>[15:2]</strong> The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.</p>
<p><strong>[15:3]</strong> In every place are the eyes of Jehovah, Watching the evil and the good.</p>
<p><strong>[15:4]</strong> A healed tongue `is&rsquo; a tree of life, And perverseness in it &ndash; a breach in the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>[15:5]</strong> A fool despiseth the instruction of his father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.</p>
<p><strong>[15:6]</strong> <code>In' the house of the righteous </code>is&rsquo; abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked &ndash; trouble.</p>
<p><strong>[15:7]</strong> The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, And the heart of fools `is&rsquo; not right.</p>
<p><strong>[15:8]</strong> The sacrifice of the wicked <code>is' an abomination to Jehovah, And the prayer of the upright </code>is&rsquo; His delight.</p>
<p><strong>[15:9]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah `is&rsquo; the way of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth.</p>
<p><strong>[15:10]</strong> Chastisement `is&rsquo; grievous to him who is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth.</p>
<p><strong>[15:11]</strong> Sheol and destruction `are&rsquo; before Jehovah, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men.</p>
<p><strong>[15:12]</strong> A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto the wise he goeth not.</p>
<p><strong>[15:13]</strong> A joyful heart maketh glad the face, And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.</p>
<p><strong>[15:14]</strong> The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.</p>
<p><strong>[15:15]</strong> All the days of the afflicted <code>are' evil, And gladness of heart </code>is&rsquo; a perpetual banquet.</p>
<p><strong>[15:16]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; a little with the fear of Jehovah, Than much treasure, and tumult with it.</p>
<p><strong>[15:17]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; an allowance of green herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it.</p>
<p><strong>[15:18]</strong> A man of fury stirreth up contention, And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p><strong>[15:19]</strong> The way of the slothful `is&rsquo; as a hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up.</p>
<p><strong>[15:20]</strong> A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother.</p>
<p><strong>[15:21]</strong> Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And a man of intelligence directeth `his&rsquo; going.</p>
<p><strong>[15:22]</strong> Without counsel `is&rsquo; the making void of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established.</p>
<p><strong>[15:23]</strong> Joy `is&rsquo; to a man in the answer of his mouth, And a word in its season &ndash; how good!</p>
<p><strong>[15:24]</strong> A path of life `is&rsquo; on high for the wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath.</p>
<p><strong>[15:25]</strong> The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.</p>
<p><strong>[15:26]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah <code>are' thoughts of wickedness, And pure </code>are&rsquo; sayings of pleasantness.</p>
<p><strong>[15:27]</strong> A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, And whoso is hating gifts liveth.</p>
<p><strong>[15:28]</strong> The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.</p>
<p><strong>[15:29]</strong> Far `is&rsquo; Jehovah from the wicked, And the prayer of the righteous He heareth.</p>
<p><strong>[15:30]</strong> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, A good report maketh fat the bone.</p>
<p><strong>[15:31]</strong> An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise.</p>
<p><strong>[15:32]</strong> Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[15:33]</strong> The fear of Jehovah <code>is' the instruction of wisdom, And before honour </code>is&rsquo; humility!</p>
<p><strong>[16:1]</strong> Of man `are&rsquo; arrangements of the heart, And from Jehovah an answer of the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>[16:2]</strong> All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering the spirits.</p>
<p><strong>[16:3]</strong> Roll unto Jehovah thy works, And established are thy purposes,</p>
<p><strong>[16:4]</strong> All things hath Jehovah wrought for Himself, And also the wicked `worketh&rsquo; for a day of evil.</p>
<p><strong>[16:5]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah `is&rsquo; every proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted.</p>
<p><strong>[16:6]</strong> In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity, And in the fear of Jehovah Turn thou aside from evil.</p>
<p><strong>[16:7]</strong> When a man&rsquo;s ways please Jehovah, even his enemies, He causeth to be at peace with him.</p>
<p><strong>[16:8]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; a little with righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice.</p>
<p><strong>[16:9]</strong> The heart of man deviseth his way, And Jehovah establisheth his step.</p>
<p><strong>[16:10]</strong> An oath `is&rsquo; on the lips of a king, In judgment his mouth trespasseth not.</p>
<p><strong>[16:11]</strong> A just beam and balances <code>are' Jehovah's, His work </code>are&rsquo; all the stones of the bag.</p>
<p><strong>[16:12]</strong> An abomination to kings `is&rsquo; doing wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established.</p>
<p><strong>[16:13]</strong> The delight of kings `are&rsquo; righteous lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth,</p>
<p><strong>[16:14]</strong> The fury of a king `is&rsquo; messengers of death, And a wise man pacifieth it.</p>
<p><strong>[16:15]</strong> In the light of a king&rsquo;s face <code>is' life, And his good-will </code>is&rsquo; as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p><strong>[16:16]</strong> To get wisdom &ndash; how much better than gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p><strong>[16:17]</strong> A highway of the upright <code>is', </code>Turn from evil,&rsquo; Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way.</p>
<p><strong>[16:18]</strong> Before destruction `is&rsquo; pride, And before stumbling &ndash; a haughty spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:19]</strong> Better is humility of spirit with the poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.</p>
<p><strong>[16:20]</strong> The wise in any matter findeth good, And whoso is trusting in Jehovah, O his happiness.</p>
<p><strong>[16:21]</strong> To the wise in heart is called, `Intelligent,&rsquo; And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p><strong>[16:22]</strong> A fountain of life `is&rsquo; understanding to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly.</p>
<p><strong>[16:23]</strong> The heart of the wise causeth his mouth to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,</p>
<p><strong>[16:24]</strong> Sayings of pleasantness `are&rsquo; a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone.</p>
<p><strong>[16:25]</strong> There is a way right before a man, And its latter end &ndash; ways of death.</p>
<p><strong>[16:26]</strong> A labouring man hath laboured for himself, For his mouth hath caused `him&rsquo; to bend over it.</p>
<p><strong>[16:27]</strong> A worthless man is preparing evil, And on his lips &ndash; as a burning fire.</p>
<p><strong>[16:28]</strong> A froward man sendeth forth contention, A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.</p>
<p><strong>[16:29]</strong> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, And hath causeth him to go in a way not good.</p>
<p><strong>[16:30]</strong> Consulting his eyes to devise froward things, Moving his lips he hath accomplished evil.</p>
<p><strong>[16:31]</strong> A crown of beauty `are&rsquo; grey hairs, In the way of righteousness it is found.</p>
<p><strong>[16:32]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; the slow to anger than the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city.</p>
<p><strong>[16:33]</strong> Into the centre is the lot cast, And from Jehovah `is&rsquo; all its judgment!</p>
<p><strong>[17:1]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; a dry morsel, and rest with it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.</p>
<p><strong>[17:2]</strong> A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame, And in the midst of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>[17:3]</strong> A refining pot <code>is' for silver, and a furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts </code>is&rsquo; Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[17:4]</strong> An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>
<p><strong>[17:5]</strong> Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.</p>
<p><strong>[17:6]</strong> Sons&rsquo; sons <code>are' the crown of old men, And the glory of sons </code>are&rsquo; their fathers.</p>
<p><strong>[17:7]</strong> Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.</p>
<p><strong>[17:8]</strong> A stone of grace `is&rsquo; the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>
<p><strong>[17:9]</strong> Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar friend.</p>
<p><strong>[17:10]</strong> Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[17:11]</strong> An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And a fierce messenger is sent against him.</p>
<p><strong>[17:12]</strong> The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, And &ndash; not a fool in his folly.</p>
<p><strong>[17:13]</strong> Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil moveth not from his house.</p>
<p><strong>[17:14]</strong> The beginning of contention `is&rsquo; a letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.</p>
<p><strong>[17:15]</strong> Whoso is justifying the wicked, And condemning the righteous, Even both of these `are&rsquo; an abomination to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[17:16]</strong> Why `is&rsquo; this &ndash; a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?</p>
<p><strong>[17:17]</strong> At all times is the friend loving, And a brother for adversity is born.</p>
<p><strong>[17:18]</strong> A man lacking heart is striking hands, A surety he becometh before his friend.</p>
<p><strong>[17:19]</strong> Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[17:20]</strong> The perverse of heart findeth not good, And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.</p>
<p><strong>[17:21]</strong> Whoso is begetting a fool hath affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.</p>
<p><strong>[17:22]</strong> A rejoicing heart doth good to the body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.</p>
<p><strong>[17:23]</strong> A bribe from the bosom the wicked taketh, To turn aside the paths of judgment.</p>
<p><strong>[17:24]</strong> The face of the intelligent `is&rsquo; to wisdom, And the eyes of a fool &ndash; at the end of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[17:25]</strong> A provocation to his father `is&rsquo; a foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
<p><strong>[17:26]</strong> Also, to fine the righteous is not good, To smite nobles for uprightness.</p>
<p><strong>[17:27]</strong> One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, And the cool of temper `is&rsquo; a man of understanding.</p>
<p><strong>[17:28]</strong> Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!</p>
<p><strong>[18:1]</strong> For `an object of&rsquo; desire he who is separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.</p>
<p><strong>[18:2]</strong> A fool delighteth not in understanding, But &ndash; in uncovering his heart.</p>
<p><strong>[18:3]</strong> With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt, And with shame &ndash; reproach.</p>
<p><strong>[18:4]</strong> Deep waters <code>are' the words of a man's mouth, The fountain of wisdom </code>is&rsquo; a flowing brook.</p>
<p><strong>[18:5]</strong> Acceptance of the face of the wicked `is&rsquo; not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p><strong>[18:6]</strong> The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes calleth.</p>
<p><strong>[18:7]</strong> The mouth of a fool <code>is' ruin to him, And his lips </code>are&rsquo; the snare of his soul.</p>
<p><strong>[18:8]</strong> The words of a tale-bearer <code>are' as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down </code>to&rsquo; the inner parts of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>[18:9]</strong> He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he `is&rsquo; to a destroyer.</p>
<p><strong>[18:10]</strong> A tower of strength `is&rsquo; the name of Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.</p>
<p><strong>[18:11]</strong> The wealth of the rich `is&rsquo; the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.</p>
<p><strong>[18:12]</strong> Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour `is&rsquo; humility.</p>
<p><strong>[18:13]</strong> Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.</p>
<p><strong>[18:14]</strong> The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?</p>
<p><strong>[18:15]</strong> The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[18:16]</strong> The gift of a man maketh room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.</p>
<p><strong>[18:17]</strong> Righteous `is&rsquo; the first in his own cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him.</p>
<p><strong>[18:18]</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separateth.</p>
<p><strong>[18:19]</strong> A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.</p>
<p><strong>[18:20]</strong> From the fruit of a man&rsquo;s mouth is his belly satisfied, `From the&rsquo; increase of his lips he is satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>[18:21]</strong> Death and life `are&rsquo; in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[18:22]</strong> `Whoso&rsquo; hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[18:23]</strong> `With&rsquo; supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.</p>
<p><strong>[18:24]</strong> A man with friends `is&rsquo; to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!</p>
<p><strong>[19:1]</strong> Better <code>is' the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse </code>in&rsquo; his lips, who `is&rsquo; a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[19:2]</strong> Also, without knowledge the soul `is&rsquo; not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.</p>
<p><strong>[19:3]</strong> The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Jehovah is his heart wroth.</p>
<p><strong>[19:4]</strong> Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.</p>
<p><strong>[19:5]</strong> A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.</p>
<p><strong>[19:6]</strong> Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.</p>
<p><strong>[19:7]</strong> All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words &ndash; they are not!</p>
<p><strong>[19:8]</strong> Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.</p>
<p><strong>[19:9]</strong> A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.</p>
<p><strong>[19:10]</strong> Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.</p>
<p><strong>[19:11]</strong> The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory `is&rsquo; to pass over transgression.</p>
<p><strong>[19:12]</strong> The wrath of a king `is&rsquo; a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.</p>
<p><strong>[19:13]</strong> A calamity to his father <code>is' a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife </code>are&rsquo; a continual dropping.</p>
<p><strong>[19:14]</strong> House and wealth <code>are' the inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; an understanding wife.</p>
<p><strong>[19:15]</strong> Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul doth hunger.</p>
<p><strong>[19:16]</strong> Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.</p>
<p><strong>[19:17]</strong> Whoso is lending `to&rsquo; Jehovah is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.</p>
<p><strong>[19:18]</strong> Chastise thy son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.</p>
<p><strong>[19:19]</strong> A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.</p>
<p><strong>[19:20]</strong> Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that thou art wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p><strong>[19:21]</strong> Many `are&rsquo; the purposes in a man&rsquo;s heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth.</p>
<p><strong>[19:22]</strong> The desirableness of a man <code>is' his kindness, And better </code>is&rsquo; the poor than a liar.</p>
<p><strong>[19:23]</strong> The fear of Jehovah `is&rsquo; to life, And satisfied he remaineth &ndash; he is not charged with evil.</p>
<p><strong>[19:24]</strong> The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.</p>
<p><strong>[19:25]</strong> A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[19:26]</strong> Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.</p>
<p><strong>[19:27]</strong> Cease, my son, to hear instruction &ndash; To err from sayings of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[19:28]</strong> A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.</p>
<p><strong>[19:29]</strong> Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!</p>
<p><strong>[20:1]</strong> Wine <code>is' a scorner -- strong drink </code>is&rsquo; noisy, And any going astray in it is not wise.</p>
<p><strong>[20:2]</strong> The fear of a king `is&rsquo; a growl as of a young lion, He who is causing him to be wroth is wronging his soul.</p>
<p><strong>[20:3]</strong> An honour to a man is cessation from strife, And every fool intermeddleth.</p>
<p><strong>[20:4]</strong> Because of winter the slothful plougheth not, He asketh in harvest, and there is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[20:5]</strong> Counsel in the heart of a man `is&rsquo; deep water, And a man of understanding draweth it up.</p>
<p><strong>[20:6]</strong> A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness, And a man of stedfastness who doth find?</p>
<p><strong>[20:7]</strong> The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!</p>
<p><strong>[20:8]</strong> A king sitting on a throne of judgment, Is scattering with his eyes all evil,</p>
<p><strong>[20:9]</strong> Who saith, `I have purified my heart, I have been cleansed from my sin?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:10]</strong> A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, Even both of them `are&rsquo; an abomination to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[20:11]</strong> Even by his actions a youth maketh himself known, Whether his work be pure or upright.</p>
<p><strong>[20:12]</strong> A hearing ear, and a seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.</p>
<p><strong>[20:13]</strong> Love not sleep, lest thou become poor, Open thine eyes &ndash; be satisfied `with&rsquo; bread.</p>
<p><strong>[20:14]</strong> `Bad, bad,&rsquo; saith the buyer, And going his way then he boasteth himself.</p>
<p><strong>[20:15]</strong> Substance, gold, and a multitude of rubies, Yea, a precious vessel, `are&rsquo; lips of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[20:16]</strong> Take his garment when a stranger hath been surety, And for strangers pledge it.</p>
<p><strong>[20:17]</strong> Sweet to a man <code>is' the bread of falsehood, And afterwards is his mouth filled </code>with&rsquo; gravel.</p>
<p><strong>[20:18]</strong> Purposes by counsel thou dost establish, And with plans make thou war.</p>
<p><strong>[20:19]</strong> A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody, And for a deceiver `with&rsquo; his lips make not thyself surety.</p>
<p><strong>[20:20]</strong> Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>[20:21]</strong> An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, Even its latter end is not blessed.</p>
<p><strong>[20:22]</strong> Do not say, `I recompense evil,&rsquo; Wait for Jehovah, and He delivereth thee.</p>
<p><strong>[20:23]</strong> An abomination to Jehovah <code>are' a stone and a stone, And balances of deceit </code>are&rsquo; not good.</p>
<p><strong>[20:24]</strong> From Jehovah `are&rsquo; the steps of a man, And man &ndash; how understandeth he his way?</p>
<p><strong>[20:25]</strong> A snare to a man `is&rsquo; he hath swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>[20:26]</strong> A wise king is scattering the wicked, And turneth back on them the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>[20:27]</strong> The breath of man `is&rsquo; a lamp of Jehovah, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>[20:28]</strong> Kindness and truth keep a king, And he hath supported by kindness his throne.</p>
<p><strong>[20:29]</strong> The beauty of young men is their strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.</p>
<p><strong>[20:30]</strong> The bandages of a wound thou removest with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!</p>
<p><strong>[21:1]</strong> Rivulets of waters `is&rsquo; the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.</p>
<p><strong>[21:2]</strong> Every way of a man `is&rsquo; right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.</p>
<p><strong>[21:3]</strong> To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>[21:4]</strong> Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked `is&rsquo; sin.</p>
<p><strong>[21:5]</strong> The purposes of the diligent `are&rsquo; only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.</p>
<p><strong>[21:6]</strong> The making of treasures by a lying tongue, `Is&rsquo; a vanity driven away of those seeking death.</p>
<p><strong>[21:7]</strong> The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.</p>
<p><strong>[21:8]</strong> Froward <code>is' the way of a man who is vile, And the pure -- upright </code>is&rsquo; his work.</p>
<p><strong>[21:9]</strong> Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than `with&rsquo; a woman of contentions and a house of company.</p>
<p><strong>[21:10]</strong> The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.</p>
<p><strong>[21:11]</strong> When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[21:12]</strong> The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>[21:13]</strong> Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.</p>
<p><strong>[21:14]</strong> A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.</p>
<p><strong>[21:15]</strong> To do justice `is&rsquo; joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><strong>[21:16]</strong> A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.</p>
<p><strong>[21:17]</strong> Whoso <code>is' loving mirth </code>is&rsquo; a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.</p>
<p><strong>[21:18]</strong> The wicked `is&rsquo; an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.</p>
<p><strong>[21:19]</strong> Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than `with&rsquo; a woman of contentions and anger.</p>
<p><strong>[21:20]</strong> A treasure to be desired, and oil, `Is&rsquo; in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.</p>
<p><strong>[21:21]</strong> Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p><strong>[21:22]</strong> A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.</p>
<p><strong>[21:23]</strong> Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.</p>
<p><strong>[21:24]</strong> Proud, haughty, scorner `is&rsquo; his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.</p>
<p><strong>[21:25]</strong> The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.</p>
<p><strong>[21:26]</strong> All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.</p>
<p><strong>[21:27]</strong> The sacrifice of the wicked `is&rsquo; abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.</p>
<p><strong>[21:28]</strong> A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.</p>
<p><strong>[21:29]</strong> A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright &ndash; he prepareth his way.</p>
<p><strong>[21:30]</strong> There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[21:31]</strong> A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance `is&rsquo; of Jehovah!</p>
<p><strong>[22:1]</strong> A name is chosen rather than much wealth, Than silver and than gold &ndash; good grace.</p>
<p><strong>[22:2]</strong> Rich and poor have met together, The Maker of them all `is&rsquo; Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[22:3]</strong> The prudent hath seen the evil, and is hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.</p>
<p><strong>[22:4]</strong> The end of humility `is&rsquo; the fear of Jehovah, Riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p><strong>[22:5]</strong> Thorns &ndash; snares `are&rsquo; in the way of the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them.</p>
<p><strong>[22:6]</strong> Give instruction to a youth about his way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.</p>
<p><strong>[22:7]</strong> The rich over the poor ruleth, And a servant `is&rsquo; the borrower to the lender.</p>
<p><strong>[22:8]</strong> Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.</p>
<p><strong>[22:9]</strong> The good of eye &ndash; he is blessed, For he hath given of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>[22:10]</strong> Cast out a scorner &ndash; and contention goeth out, And strife and shame cease.</p>
<p><strong>[22:11]</strong> Whoso is loving cleanness of heart, Grace <code>are' his lips, a king </code>is&rsquo; his friend.</p>
<p><strong>[22:12]</strong> The eyes of Jehovah have kept knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.</p>
<p><strong>[22:13]</strong> The slothful hath said, <code>A lion </code>is&rsquo; without, In the midst of the broad places I am slain.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:14]</strong> A deep pit `is&rsquo; the mouth of strange women, The abhorred of Jehovah falleth there.</p>
<p><strong>[22:15]</strong> Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.</p>
<p><strong>[22:16]</strong> He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him, He is giving to the rich &ndash; only to want.</p>
<p><strong>[22:17]</strong> Incline thine ear, and hear words of the wise, And thy heart set to my knowledge,</p>
<p><strong>[22:18]</strong> For they are pleasant when thou dost keep them in thy heart, They are prepared together for thy lips.</p>
<p><strong>[22:19]</strong> That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know to-day, even thou.</p>
<p><strong>[22:20]</strong> Have I not written to thee three times With counsels and knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>[22:21]</strong> To cause thee to know the certainty of sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending thee.</p>
<p><strong>[22:22]</strong> Rob not the poor because he `is&rsquo; poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate.</p>
<p><strong>[22:23]</strong> For Jehovah pleadeth their cause, And hath spoiled the soul of their spoilers.</p>
<p><strong>[22:24]</strong> Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man, And with a man of fury go not in,</p>
<p><strong>[22:25]</strong> Lest thou learn his paths, And have received a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p><strong>[22:26]</strong> Be not thou among those striking hands, Among sureties `for&rsquo; burdens.</p>
<p><strong>[22:27]</strong> If thou hast nothing to pay, Why doth he take thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p><strong>[22:28]</strong> Remove not a border of olden times, That thy fathers have made.</p>
<p><strong>[22:29]</strong> Hast thou seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he doth station himself, He stations not himself before obscure men!</p>
<p><strong>[23:1]</strong> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Thou considerest diligently that which `is&rsquo; before thee,</p>
<p><strong>[23:2]</strong> And thou hast put a knife to thy throat, If thou `art&rsquo; a man of appetite.</p>
<p><strong>[23:3]</strong> Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it `is&rsquo; lying food.</p>
<p><strong>[23:4]</strong> Labour not to make wealth, From thine own understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.</p>
<p><strong>[23:5]</strong> For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>[23:6]</strong> Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,</p>
<p><strong>[23:7]</strong> For as he hath thought in his soul, so <code>is' he, </code>Eat and drink,&rsquo; saith he to thee, And his heart `is&rsquo; not with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[23:8]</strong> Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up, And hast marred thy words that `are&rsquo; sweet.</p>
<p><strong>[23:9]</strong> In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p><strong>[23:10]</strong> Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,</p>
<p><strong>[23:11]</strong> For their Redeemer `is&rsquo; strong, He doth plead their cause with thee.</p>
<p><strong>[23:12]</strong> Bring in to instruction thy heart, And thine ear to sayings of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[23:13]</strong> Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.</p>
<p><strong>[23:14]</strong> Thou with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol thou deliverest.</p>
<p><strong>[23:15]</strong> My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,</p>
<p><strong>[23:16]</strong> And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly.</p>
<p><strong>[23:17]</strong> Let not thy heart be envious at sinners, But &ndash; in the fear of Jehovah all the day.</p>
<p><strong>[23:18]</strong> For, is there a posterity? Then thy hope is not cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[23:19]</strong> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way thy heart,</p>
<p><strong>[23:20]</strong> Be not thou among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,</p>
<p><strong>[23:21]</strong> For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.</p>
<p><strong>[23:22]</strong> Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.</p>
<p><strong>[23:23]</strong> Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,</p>
<p><strong>[23:24]</strong> The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.</p>
<p><strong>[23:25]</strong> Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother, Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.</p>
<p><strong>[23:26]</strong> Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let thine eyes watch my ways.</p>
<p><strong>[23:27]</strong> For a harlot <code>is' a deep ditch, And a strange woman </code>is&rsquo; a strait pit.</p>
<p><strong>[23:28]</strong> She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.</p>
<p><strong>[23:29]</strong> Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p><strong>[23:30]</strong> Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.</p>
<p><strong>[23:31]</strong> See not wine when it showeth itself red, When it giveth in the cup its colour, It goeth up and down through the upright.</p>
<p><strong>[23:32]</strong> Its latter end &ndash; as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.</p>
<p><strong>[23:33]</strong> Thine eyes see strange women, And thy heart speaketh perverse things.</p>
<p><strong>[23:34]</strong> And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.</p>
<p><strong>[23:35]</strong> `They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake &ndash; I seek it yet again!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:1]</strong> Be not envious of evil men, And desire not to be with them.</p>
<p><strong>[24:2]</strong> For destruction doth their heart meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.</p>
<p><strong>[24:3]</strong> By wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding it establisheth itself.</p>
<p><strong>[24:4]</strong> And by knowledge the inner parts are filled, `With&rsquo; all precious and pleasant wealth.</p>
<p><strong>[24:5]</strong> Mighty `is&rsquo; the wise in strength, And a man of knowledge is strengthening power,</p>
<p><strong>[24:6]</strong> For by plans thou makest for thyself war, And deliverance `is&rsquo; in a multitude of counsellors.</p>
<p><strong>[24:7]</strong> Wisdom `is&rsquo; high for a fool, In the gate he openeth not his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[24:8]</strong> Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they call a master of wicked thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>[24:9]</strong> The thought of folly <code>is' sin, And an abomination to man </code>is&rsquo; a scorner.</p>
<p><strong>[24:10]</strong> Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day of adversity, Straitened is thy power,</p>
<p><strong>[24:11]</strong> If `from&rsquo; delivering those taken to death, And those slipping to the slaughter &ndash; thou keepest back.</p>
<p><strong>[24:12]</strong> When thou sayest, `Lo, we knew not this.&rsquo; Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the Keeper of thy soul He who knoweth? And He hath rendered to man according to his work.</p>
<p><strong>[24:13]</strong> Eat my son, honey that `is&rsquo; good, And the honeycomb &ndash; sweet to thy palate.</p>
<p><strong>[24:14]</strong> So `is&rsquo; the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul, If thou hast found that there is a posterity And thy hope is not cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[24:15]</strong> Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.</p>
<p><strong>[24:16]</strong> For seven `times&rsquo; doth the righteous fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil.</p>
<p><strong>[24:17]</strong> In the falling of thine enemy rejoice not, And in his stumbling let not thy heart be joyful,</p>
<p><strong>[24:18]</strong> Lest Jehovah see, and `it be&rsquo; evil in His eyes, And He hath turned from off him His anger.</p>
<p><strong>[24:19]</strong> Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not envious at the wicked,</p>
<p><strong>[24:20]</strong> For there is not a posterity to the evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.</p>
<p><strong>[24:21]</strong> Fear Jehovah, my son, and the king, With changers mix not up thyself,</p>
<p><strong>[24:22]</strong> For suddenly doth their calamity rise, And the ruin of them both &ndash; who knoweth!</p>
<p><strong>[24:23]</strong> These also are for the wise: &ndash; To discern faces in judgment is not good.</p>
<p><strong>[24:24]</strong> Whoso is saying to the wicked, <code>Thou </code>art&rsquo; righteous,&rsquo; Peoples execrate him &ndash; nations abhor him.</p>
<p><strong>[24:25]</strong> And to those reproving it is pleasant, And on them cometh a good blessing.</p>
<p><strong>[24:26]</strong> Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words.</p>
<p><strong>[24:27]</strong> Prepare in an out-place thy work, And make it ready in the field &ndash; go afterwards, Then thou hast built thy house.</p>
<p><strong>[24:28]</strong> Be not a witness for nought against thy neighbour, Or thou hast enticed with thy lips.</p>
<p><strong>[24:29]</strong> Say not, `As he did to me, so I do to him, I render to each according to his work.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:30]</strong> Near the field of a slothful man I passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.</p>
<p><strong>[24:31]</strong> And lo, it hath gone up &ndash; all of it &ndash; thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall hath been broken down.</p>
<p><strong>[24:32]</strong> And I see &ndash; I &ndash; I do set my heart, I have seen &ndash; I have received instruction,</p>
<p><strong>[24:33]</strong> A little sleep &ndash; a little slumber &ndash; A little folding of the hands to lie down.</p>
<p><strong>[24:34]</strong> And thy poverty hath come `as&rsquo; a traveller, And thy want as an armed man!</p>
<p><strong>[25:1]</strong> Also these are Proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed: &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[25:2]</strong> The honour of God `is&rsquo; to hide a thing, And the honour of kings to search out a matter.</p>
<p><strong>[25:3]</strong> The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, And the heart of kings &ndash; `are&rsquo; unsearchable.</p>
<p><strong>[25:4]</strong> Take away dross from silver, And a vessel for the refiner goeth forth,</p>
<p><strong>[25:5]</strong> Take away the wicked before a king, And established in righteousness is his throne.</p>
<p><strong>[25:6]</strong> Honour not thyself before a king, And in the place of the great stand not.</p>
<p><strong>[25:7]</strong> For better <code>that' he hath said to thee, </code>Come thou up hither,&rsquo; Than `that&rsquo; he humble thee before a noble, Whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p><strong>[25:8]</strong> Go not forth to strive, haste, turn, What dost thou in its latter end, When thy neighbour causeth thee to blush?</p>
<p><strong>[25:9]</strong> Thy cause plead with thy neighbour, And the secret counsel of another reveal not,</p>
<p><strong>[25:10]</strong> Lest the hearer put thee to shame, And thine evil report turn not back.</p>
<p><strong>[25:11]</strong> Apples of gold in imagery of silver, `Is&rsquo; the word spoken at its fit times.</p>
<p><strong>[25:12]</strong> A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, `Is&rsquo; the wise reprover to an attentive ear.</p>
<p><strong>[25:13]</strong> As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, `So is&rsquo; a faithful ambassador to those sending him, And the soul of his masters he refresheth.</p>
<p><strong>[25:14]</strong> Clouds and wind, and rain there is none, `Is&rsquo; a man boasting himself in a false gift.</p>
<p><strong>[25:15]</strong> By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh a bone.</p>
<p><strong>[25:16]</strong> Honey thou hast found &ndash; eat thy sufficiency, Lest thou be satiated `with&rsquo; it, and hast vomited it.</p>
<p><strong>[25:17]</strong> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour&rsquo;s house, Lest he be satiated `with&rsquo; thee, and have hated thee.</p>
<p><strong>[25:18]</strong> A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, `Is&rsquo; the man testifying against his neighbour a false testimony.</p>
<p><strong>[25:19]</strong> A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, `Is&rsquo; the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.</p>
<p><strong>[25:20]</strong> Whoso is taking away a garment in a cold day, `Is as&rsquo; vinegar on nitre, And a singer of songs on a sad heart.</p>
<p><strong>[25:21]</strong> If he who is hating thee doth hunger, cause him to eat bread, And if he thirst, cause him to drink water.</p>
<p><strong>[25:22]</strong> For coals thou art putting on his head, And Jehovah giveth recompense to thee.</p>
<p><strong>[25:23]</strong> A north wind bringeth forth rain, And a secret tongue &ndash; indignant faces.</p>
<p><strong>[25:24]</strong> Better to sit on a corner of a roof, Than `with&rsquo; a woman of contentions, and a house of company.</p>
<p><strong>[25:25]</strong> <code>As' cold waters for a weary soul, So </code>is&rsquo; a good report from a far country.</p>
<p><strong>[25:26]</strong> A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, `Is&rsquo; the righteous falling before the wicked.</p>
<p><strong>[25:27]</strong> The eating of much honey is not good, Nor a searching out of one&rsquo;s own honour &ndash; honour.</p>
<p><strong>[25:28]</strong> A city broken down without walls, `Is&rsquo; a man without restraint over his spirit!</p>
<p><strong>[26:1]</strong> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour `is&rsquo; not comely for a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[26:2]</strong> As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.</p>
<p><strong>[26:3]</strong> A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.</p>
<p><strong>[26:4]</strong> Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou be like to him &ndash; even thou.</p>
<p><strong>[26:5]</strong> Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>[26:6]</strong> He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[26:7]</strong> Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p><strong>[26:8]</strong> As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So `is&rsquo; he who is giving honour to a fool.</p>
<p><strong>[26:9]</strong> A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p><strong>[26:10]</strong> Great `is&rsquo; the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.</p>
<p><strong>[26:11]</strong> As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.</p>
<p><strong>[26:12]</strong> Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!</p>
<p><strong>[26:13]</strong> The slothful hath said, <code>A lion </code>is&rsquo; in the way, A lion `is&rsquo; in the broad places.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[26:14]</strong> The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.</p>
<p><strong>[26:15]</strong> The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[26:16]</strong> Wiser <code>is' the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven </code>men&rsquo; returning a reason.</p>
<p><strong>[26:17]</strong> Laying hold on the ears of a dog, `Is&rsquo; a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.</p>
<p><strong>[26:18]</strong> As `one&rsquo; pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,</p>
<p><strong>[26:19]</strong> So hath a man deceived his neighbour, And hath said, `Am not I playing?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[26:20]</strong> Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,</p>
<p><strong>[26:21]</strong> Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.</p>
<p><strong>[26:22]</strong> The words of a tale-bearer <code>are' as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down </code>to&rsquo; the inner parts of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>[26:23]</strong> Silver of dross spread over potsherd, `Are&rsquo; burning lips and an evil heart.</p>
<p><strong>[26:24]</strong> By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,</p>
<p><strong>[26:25]</strong> When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations `are&rsquo; in his heart.</p>
<p><strong>[26:26]</strong> Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.</p>
<p><strong>[26:27]</strong> Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.</p>
<p><strong>[26:28]</strong> A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!</p>
<p><strong>[27:1]</strong> Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.</p>
<p><strong>[27:2]</strong> Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.</p>
<p><strong>[27:3]</strong> A stone <code>is' heavy, and the sand </code>is&rsquo; heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.</p>
<p><strong>[27:4]</strong> Fury <code>is' fierce, and anger </code>is&rsquo; overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?</p>
<p><strong>[27:5]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; open reproof than hidden love.</p>
<p><strong>[27:6]</strong> Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.</p>
<p><strong>[27:7]</strong> A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And <code>to' a hungry soul every bitter thing </code>is&rsquo; sweet.</p>
<p><strong>[27:8]</strong> As a bird wandering from her nest, So `is&rsquo; a man wandering from his place.</p>
<p><strong>[27:9]</strong> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one&rsquo;s friend &ndash; from counsel of the soul.</p>
<p><strong>[27:10]</strong> Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better `is&rsquo; a near neighbour than a brother afar off.</p>
<p><strong>[27:11]</strong> Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.</p>
<p><strong>[27:12]</strong> The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.</p>
<p><strong>[27:13]</strong> Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.</p>
<p><strong>[27:14]</strong> Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.</p>
<p><strong>[27:15]</strong> A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,</p>
<p><strong>[27:16]</strong> Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.</p>
<p><strong>[27:17]</strong> Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.</p>
<p><strong>[27:18]</strong> The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.</p>
<p><strong>[27:19]</strong> As <code>in' water the face </code>is&rsquo; to face, So the heart of man to man.</p>
<p><strong>[27:20]</strong> Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>[27:21]</strong> A refining pot `is&rsquo; for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.</p>
<p><strong>[27:22]</strong> If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things &ndash; with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.</p>
<p><strong>[27:23]</strong> Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,</p>
<p><strong>[27:24]</strong> For riches `are&rsquo; not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.</p>
<p><strong>[27:25]</strong> Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.</p>
<p><strong>[27:26]</strong> Lambs <code>are' for thy clothing, And the price of the field </code>are&rsquo; he-goats,</p>
<p><strong>[27:27]</strong> And a sufficiency of goats&rsquo; milk `is&rsquo; for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!</p>
<p><strong>[28:1]</strong> The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.</p>
<p><strong>[28:2]</strong> By the transgression of a land many `are&rsquo; its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right &ndash; it is prolonged.</p>
<p><strong>[28:3]</strong> A man &ndash; poor and oppressing the weak, `Is&rsquo; a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.</p>
<p><strong>[28:4]</strong> Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.</p>
<p><strong>[28:5]</strong> Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.</p>
<p><strong>[28:6]</strong> Better `is&rsquo; the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.</p>
<p><strong>[28:7]</strong> Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.</p>
<p><strong>[28:8]</strong> Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.</p>
<p><strong>[28:9]</strong> Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer `is&rsquo; an abomination.</p>
<p><strong>[28:10]</strong> Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.</p>
<p><strong>[28:11]</strong> A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.</p>
<p><strong>[28:12]</strong> In the exulting of the righteous the glory `is&rsquo; abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>[28:13]</strong> Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.</p>
<p><strong>[28:14]</strong> O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.</p>
<p><strong>[28:15]</strong> A growling lion, and a ranging bear, `Is&rsquo; the wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
<p><strong>[28:16]</strong> A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.</p>
<p><strong>[28:17]</strong> A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.</p>
<p><strong>[28:18]</strong> Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.</p>
<p><strong>[28:19]</strong> Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied <code>with' bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled </code>with&rsquo; poverty.</p>
<p><strong>[28:20]</strong> A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.</p>
<p><strong>[28:21]</strong> To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.</p>
<p><strong>[28:22]</strong> Troubled for wealth <code>is' the man </code>with&rsquo; an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.</p>
<p><strong>[28:23]</strong> Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>[28:24]</strong> Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, `It is not transgression,&rsquo; A companion he is to a destroyer.</p>
<p><strong>[28:25]</strong> Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.</p>
<p><strong>[28:26]</strong> Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>[28:27]</strong> Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.</p>
<p><strong>[28:28]</strong> In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!</p>
<p><strong>[29:1]</strong> A man often reproved, hardening the neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.</p>
<p><strong>[29:2]</strong> In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.</p>
<p><strong>[29:3]</strong> A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father, And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.</p>
<p><strong>[29:4]</strong> A king by judgment establisheth a land, And one receiving gifts throweth it down.</p>
<p><strong>[29:5]</strong> A man taking a portion above his neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.</p>
<p><strong>[29:6]</strong> In the transgression of the evil `is&rsquo; a snare, And the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</p>
<p><strong>[29:7]</strong> The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[29:8]</strong> Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the wise turn back anger.</p>
<p><strong>[29:9]</strong> A wise man is judged by the foolish man, And he hath been angry, And he hath laughed, and there is no rest.</p>
<p><strong>[29:10]</strong> Men of blood hate the perfect, And the upright seek his soul.</p>
<p><strong>[29:11]</strong> A fool bringeth out all his mind, And the wise till afterwards restraineth it.</p>
<p><strong>[29:12]</strong> A ruler who is attending to lying words, All his ministers `are&rsquo; wicked.</p>
<p><strong>[29:13]</strong> The poor and the man of frauds have met together, Jehovah is enlightening the eyes of them both.</p>
<p><strong>[29:14]</strong> a king that is judging truly the poor, His throne for ever is established.</p>
<p><strong>[29:15]</strong> A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a youth let away is shaming his mother.</p>
<p><strong>[29:16]</strong> In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.</p>
<p><strong>[29:17]</strong> Chastise thy son, and he giveth thee comfort, Yea, he giveth delights to thy soul.</p>
<p><strong>[29:18]</strong> Without a Vision is a people made naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!</p>
<p><strong>[29:19]</strong> By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, And there is nothing answering.</p>
<p><strong>[29:20]</strong> Thou hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p><strong>[29:21]</strong> Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, `At&rsquo; his latter end also he is continuator.</p>
<p><strong>[29:22]</strong> An angry man stirreth up contention, And a furious man is multiplying transgression.</p>
<p><strong>[29:23]</strong> The pride of man humbleth him, And humility of spirit upholdeth honour.</p>
<p><strong>[29:24]</strong> Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.</p>
<p><strong>[29:25]</strong> Fear of man causeth a snare, And the confident in Jehovah is set on high.</p>
<p><strong>[29:26]</strong> Many are seeking the face of a ruler, And from Jehovah `is&rsquo; the judgment of each.</p>
<p><strong>[29:27]</strong> An abomination to the righteous <code>is' the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked </code>is&rsquo; the upright in the way!</p>
<p><strong>[30:1]</strong> Words of a Gatherer, son of an obedient one, the declaration, an affirmation of the man: &ndash; I have wearied myself <code>for' God, I have wearied myself </code>for&rsquo; God, and am consumed.</p>
<p><strong>[30:2]</strong> For I am more brutish than any one, And have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p><strong>[30:3]</strong> Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the knowledge of Holy Ones I know.</p>
<p><strong>[30:4]</strong> Who went up to heaven, and cometh down? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What `is&rsquo; His name? and what His son&rsquo;s name? Surely thou knowest!</p>
<p><strong>[30:5]</strong> Every saying of God <code>is' tried, A shield He </code>is&rsquo; to those trusting in Him.</p>
<p><strong>[30:6]</strong> Add not to His words, lest He reason with thee, And thou hast been found false.</p>
<p><strong>[30:7]</strong> Two things I have asked from Thee, Withhold not from me before I die.</p>
<p><strong>[30:8]</strong> Vanity and a lying word put far from me, Poverty or wealth give not to me, Cause me to eat the bread of my portion,</p>
<p><strong>[30:9]</strong> Lest I become satiated, and have denied, And have said, <code>Who </code>is&rsquo; Jehovah?&rsquo; And lest I be poor, and have stolen, And have laid hold of the name of my God.</p>
<p><strong>[30:10]</strong> Accuse not a servant unto his lord, Lest he disesteem thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>
<p><strong>[30:11]</strong> A generation `is&rsquo;, that lightly esteemeth their father, And their mother doth not bless.</p>
<p><strong>[30:12]</strong> A generation &ndash; pure in their own eyes, But from their own filth not washed.</p>
<p><strong>[30:13]</strong> A generation &ndash; how high are their eyes, Yea, their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p><strong>[30:14]</strong> A generation &ndash; swords <code>are' their teeth, And knives -- their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth, And the needy from </code>among&rsquo; men.</p>
<p><strong>[30:15]</strong> To the leech <code>are' two daughters, </code>Give, give, Lo, three things are not satisfied, Four have not said `Sufficiency;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[30:16]</strong> Sheol, and a restrained womb, Earth &ndash; it <code>is' not satisfied </code>with&rsquo; water, And fire &ndash; it hath not said, `Sufficiency,&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[30:17]</strong> An eye that mocketh at a father, And despiseth to obey a mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat it do young eagles.</p>
<p><strong>[30:18]</strong> Three things have been too wonderful for me, Yea, four that I have not known:</p>
<p><strong>[30:19]</strong> The way of the eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the way of a man in youth.</p>
<p><strong>[30:20]</strong> So &ndash; the way of an adulterous woman, She hath eaten and hath wiped her mouth, And hath said, `I have not done iniquity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[30:21]</strong> For three things hath earth been troubled, And for four &ndash; it is not able to bear:</p>
<p><strong>[30:22]</strong> For a servant when he reigneth, And a fool when he is satisfied with bread,</p>
<p><strong>[30:23]</strong> For a hated one when she ruleth, And a maid-servant when she succeedeth her mistress.</p>
<p><strong>[30:24]</strong> Four `are&rsquo; little ones of earth, And they are made wiser than the wise:</p>
<p><strong>[30:25]</strong> The ants `are&rsquo; a people not strong, And they prepare in summer their food,</p>
<p><strong>[30:26]</strong> Conies `are&rsquo; a people not strong, And they place in a rock their house,</p>
<p><strong>[30:27]</strong> A king there is not to the locust, And it goeth out &ndash; each one shouting,</p>
<p><strong>[30:28]</strong> A spider with two hands taketh hold, And is in the palaces of a king.</p>
<p><strong>[30:29]</strong> Three there are going well, Yea, four are good in going:</p>
<p><strong>[30:30]</strong> An old lion &ndash; mighty among beasts, That turneth not back from the face of any,</p>
<p><strong>[30:31]</strong> A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat, And a king &ndash; no rising up with him.</p>
<p><strong>[30:32]</strong> If thou hast been foolish in lifting up thyself, And if thou hast devised evil &ndash; hand to mouth!</p>
<p><strong>[30:33]</strong> For the churning of milk bringeth out butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth out blood, And the forcing of anger bringeth out strife!</p>
<p><strong>[31:1]</strong> Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:</p>
<p><strong>[31:2]</strong> `What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?</p>
<p><strong>[31:3]</strong> Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away of kings.</p>
<p><strong>[31:4]</strong> Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.</p>
<p><strong>[31:5]</strong> Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.</p>
<p><strong>[31:6]</strong> Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,</p>
<p><strong>[31:7]</strong> He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembereth not again.</p>
<p><strong>[31:8]</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.</p>
<p><strong>[31:9]</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:10]</strong> A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies `is&rsquo; her price.</p>
<p><strong>[31:11]</strong> The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.</p>
<p><strong>[31:12]</strong> She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.</p>
<p><strong>[31:13]</strong> She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh `with&rsquo; her hands.</p>
<p><strong>[31:14]</strong> She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she bringeth in her bread.</p>
<p><strong>[31:15]</strong> Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.</p>
<p><strong>[31:16]</strong> She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p>
<p><strong>[31:17]</strong> She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen her arms.</p>
<p><strong>[31:18]</strong> She hath perceived when her merchandise `is&rsquo; good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.</p>
<p><strong>[31:19]</strong> Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.</p>
<p><strong>[31:20]</strong> Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.</p>
<p><strong>[31:21]</strong> She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed `with&rsquo; scarlet.</p>
<p><strong>[31:22]</strong> Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and purple `are&rsquo; her clothing.</p>
<p><strong>[31:23]</strong> Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[31:24]</strong> Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.</p>
<p><strong>[31:25]</strong> Strength and honour `are&rsquo; her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.</p>
<p><strong>[31:26]</strong> Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness `is&rsquo; on her tongue.</p>
<p><strong>[31:27]</strong> She `is&rsquo; watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.</p>
<p><strong>[31:28]</strong> Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,</p>
<p><strong>[31:29]</strong> <code>Many </code>are&rsquo; the daughters who have done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:30]</strong> The grace <code>is' false, and the beauty </code>is&rsquo; vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.</p>
<p><strong>[31:31]</strong> Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!</p>
