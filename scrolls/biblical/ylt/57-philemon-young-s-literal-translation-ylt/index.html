<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that `is&rsquo; in you toward Christ Jesus;</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> I entreat thee concerning my child &ndash; whom I did beget in my bonds &ndash; Onesimus,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> no more as a servant, but above a servant &ndash; a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> I, Paul did write with my hand, I &ndash; I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is&rsquo; with your spirit! Amen.</p>
