<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> to Timotheus &ndash; genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus &ndash; I going on to Macedonia &ndash; that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> and we have known that the law `is&rsquo; good, if any one may use it lawfully;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> And I give thanks to him who enabled me &ndash; Christ Jesus our Lord &ndash; that he did reckon me stedfast, having put `me&rsquo; to the ministration,</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did `it&rsquo; in unbelief,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that `is&rsquo; in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> stedfast `is&rsquo; the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners &ndash; first of whom I am;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, `is&rsquo; honour and glory &ndash; to the ages of the ages! Amen.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> for this `is&rsquo; right and acceptable before God our Saviour,</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> for one <code>is' God, one also </code>is&rsquo; mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> who did give himself a ransom for all &ndash; the testimony in its own times &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle &ndash; truth I say in Christ, I do not lie &ndash; a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> but &ndash; which becometh women professing godly piety &ndash; through good works.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> for Adam was first formed, then Eve,</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> Stedfast `is&rsquo; the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> (and if any one his own house `how&rsquo; to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Ministrants &ndash; in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> Women &ndash; in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> Ministrants &ndash; let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that `is&rsquo; in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth `thee&rsquo; to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God &ndash; a pillar and foundation of the truth,</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety &ndash; God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> forbidding to marry &ndash; to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> because every creature of God <code>is' good, and nothing </code>is&rsquo; to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> and the profane and old women&rsquo;s fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> stedfast `is&rsquo; the word, and of all acceptation worthy;</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men &ndash; especially of those believing.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> Charge these things, and teach;</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee.</p>
<p><strong>[5:1]</strong> An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;</p>
<p><strong>[5:2]</strong> aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters &ndash; in all purity;</p>
<p><strong>[5:3]</strong> honour widows who are really widows;</p>
<p><strong>[5:4]</strong> and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.</p>
<p><strong>[5:5]</strong> And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,</p>
<p><strong>[5:6]</strong> and she who is given to luxury, living &ndash; hath died;</p>
<p><strong>[5:7]</strong> and these things charge, that they may be blameless;</p>
<p><strong>[5:8]</strong> and if any one for his own &ndash; and especially for those of the household &ndash; doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.</p>
<p><strong>[5:9]</strong> A widow &ndash; let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,</p>
<p><strong>[5:10]</strong> in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints&rsquo; feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;</p>
<p><strong>[5:11]</strong> and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,</p>
<p><strong>[5:12]</strong> having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,</p>
<p><strong>[5:13]</strong> and at the same time also, they learn `to be&rsquo; idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;</p>
<p><strong>[5:14]</strong> I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;</p>
<p><strong>[5:15]</strong> for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.</p>
<p><strong>[5:16]</strong> If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.</p>
<p><strong>[5:17]</strong> The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,</p>
<p><strong>[5:18]</strong> for the Writing saith, <code>An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and </code>Worthy `is&rsquo; the workman of his reward.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[5:19]</strong> Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>[5:20]</strong> Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;</p>
<p><strong>[5:21]</strong> I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p><strong>[5:22]</strong> Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;</p>
<p><strong>[5:23]</strong> no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;</p>
<p><strong>[5:24]</strong> of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;</p>
<p><strong>[5:25]</strong> in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.</p>
<p><strong>[6:1]</strong> As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;</p>
<p><strong>[6:2]</strong> and those having believing masters, let them not slight `them&rsquo;, because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;</p>
<p><strong>[6:3]</strong> if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words &ndash; those of our Lord Jesus Christ &ndash; and to the teaching according to piety,</p>
<p><strong>[6:4]</strong> he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,</p>
<p><strong>[6:5]</strong> wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;</p>
<p><strong>[6:6]</strong> but it is great gain &ndash; the piety with contentment;</p>
<p><strong>[6:7]</strong> for nothing did we bring into the world &ndash; `it is&rsquo; manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;</p>
<p><strong>[6:8]</strong> but having food and raiment &ndash; with these we shall suffice ourselves;</p>
<p><strong>[6:9]</strong> and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,</p>
<p><strong>[6:10]</strong> for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;</p>
<p><strong>[6:11]</strong> and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;</p>
<p><strong>[6:12]</strong> be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>[6:13]</strong> I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,</p>
<p><strong>[6:14]</strong> that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><strong>[6:15]</strong> which in His own times He shall shew &ndash; the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,</p>
<p><strong>[6:16]</strong> who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom `is&rsquo; honour and might age-during! Amen.</p>
<p><strong>[6:17]</strong> Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[6:18]</strong> to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,</p>
<p><strong>[6:19]</strong> treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during.</p>
<p><strong>[6:20]</strong> O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,</p>
<p><strong>[6:21]</strong> which certain professing &ndash; concerning the faith did swerve; the grace `is&rsquo; with you. Amen.</p>
