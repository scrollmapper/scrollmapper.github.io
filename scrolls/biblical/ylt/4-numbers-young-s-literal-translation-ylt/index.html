<p><strong>[5:18]</strong> and the priest hath caused the woman to stand before Jehovah, and hath uncovered the woman&rsquo;s head, and hath given into her hands the present of the memorial, it `is&rsquo; a present of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest are the bitter waters which cause the curse.</p>
<p><strong>[5:19]</strong> <code>And the priest hath caused her to swear, and hath said unto the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not turned aside </code>to&rsquo; uncleanness under thy husband, be free from these bitter waters which cause the curse;</p>

<p><strong>[5:27]</strong> yea, he hath caused her to drink the water, and it hath come to pass, if she hath been defiled, and doth commit a trespass against her husband, that the waters which cause the curse have gone into her for bitter things, and her belly hath swelled, and her thigh hath fallen, and the woman hath become an execration in the midst of her people.</p>
<p><strong>[5:28]</strong> <code>And if the woman hath not been defiled, and is clean, then she hath been acquitted, and hath been sown </code>with&rsquo; seed.</p>
<p><strong>[5:29]</strong> <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the law of jealousies, when a wife turneth aside under her husband, and hath been defiled,</p>

<p><strong>[5:31]</strong> and the man hath been acquitted from iniquity, and that woman doth bear her iniquity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[6:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[6:2]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When a man or woman doeth singularly, by vowing a vow of a Nazarite, to be separate to Jehovah;</p>

<p><strong>[6:4]</strong> all days of his separation, of anything which is made of the wine-vine, from kernels even unto husk, he doth not eat.</p>
<p><strong>[6:5]</strong> `All days of the vow of his separation a razor doth not pass over his head; till the fulness of the days which he doth separate to Jehovah he is holy; grown up hath the upper part of the hair of his head.</p>
<p><strong>[6:6]</strong> `All days of his keeping separate to Jehovah, near a dead person he doth not go;</p>
<p><strong>[6:7]</strong> for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister &ndash; he is not unclean for them at their death, for the separation of his God `is&rsquo; on his head;</p>
<p><strong>[6:8]</strong> all days of his separation he `is&rsquo; holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[6:9]</strong> `And when the dead dieth beside him in an instant, suddenly, and he hath defiled the head of his separation, then he hath shaved his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he doth shave it,</p>
<p><strong>[6:10]</strong> and on the eighth day he bringeth in two turtle-doves or two young pigeons unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting,</p>
<p><strong>[6:11]</strong> and the priest hath prepared one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering, and hath made atonement for him, because of that which he hath sinned by the body, and he hath hallowed his head on that day;</p>
<p><strong>[6:12]</strong> and he hath separated to Jehovah the days of his separation, and he hath brought in a lamb, a son of a year, for a guilt-offering, and the former days are fallen, for his separation hath been defiled.</p>
<p><strong>[6:13]</strong> <code>And this </code>is&rsquo; the law of the Nazarite; in the day of the fulness of the days of his separation doth `one&rsquo; bring him in unto the opening of the tent of meeting,</p>

<p><strong>[6:15]</strong> and a basket of unleavened things of flour, cakes mixed with oil, and thin cakes of unleavened things anointed with oil, and their present, and their libations.</p>
<p><strong>[6:16]</strong> <code>And the priest hath brought </code>them&rsquo; near before Jehovah, and hath made his sin-offering and his burnt-offering;</p>

<p><strong>[6:18]</strong> <code>And the Nazarite hath shaved (at the opening of the tent of meeting) the head of his separation, and hath taken the hair of the head of his separation, and hath put </code>it&rsquo; on the fire which `is&rsquo; under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.</p>
<p><strong>[6:19]</strong> `And the priest hath taken the boiled shoulder from the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and hath put on the palms of the Nazarite after his shaving his separation;</p>
<p><strong>[6:20]</strong> and the priest hath waved them, a wave-offering before Jehovah; it `is&rsquo; holy to the priest, besides the breast of the wave-offering, and besides the leg of the heave-offering; and afterwards doth the Nazarite drink wine.</p>
<p><strong>[6:21]</strong> <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the law of the Nazarite, who voweth his offering to Jehovah for his separation, apart from that which his hand attaineth; according to his vow which he voweth so he doth by the law of his separation.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[6:22]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[6:23]</strong> `Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, saying, Thus ye do bless the sons of Israel, saying to them,</p>

<p><strong>[8:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[8:2]</strong> `Speak unto Aaron, and thou hast said unto him, In thy causing the lights to go up, over-against the face of the candlestick do the seven lights give light.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[8:3]</strong> And Aaron doth so; over-against the face of the candlestick he hath caused its lights to go up, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[8:4]</strong> And this <code>is' the work of the candlestick: beaten work of gold; unto its thigh, unto its flower it </code>is&rsquo; beaten work; as the appearance which Jehovah shewed Moses, so he hath made the candlestick.</p>
<p><strong>[8:5]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[8:6]</strong> `Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and thou hast cleansed them.</p>
<p><strong>[8:7]</strong> `And thus thou dost to them to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them waters of atonement, and they have caused a razor to pass over all their flesh, and have washed their garments, and cleansed themselves,</p>
<p><strong>[8:8]</strong> and have taken a bullock, a son of the herd, and its present, flour mixed with oil, &ndash; and a second bullock a son of the herd thou dost take for a sin-offering,</p>
<p><strong>[8:9]</strong> and thou hast brought near the Levites before the tent of meeting, and thou hast assembled the whole company of the sons of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[8:10]</strong> and thou hast brought near the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel have laid their hands on the Levites,</p>
<p><strong>[8:11]</strong> and Aaron hath waved the Levites &ndash; a wave-offering before Jehovah, from the sons of Israel, and they have been &ndash; for doing the service of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[8:12]</strong> `And the Levites lay their hands on the head of the bullocks, and make thou the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering to Jehovah, to atone for the Levites,</p>
<p><strong>[8:13]</strong> and thou hast caused the Levites to stand before Aaron, and before his sons, and hast waved them &ndash; a wave-offering to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[8:14]</strong> and thou hast separated the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and the Levites have become Mine;</p>
<p><strong>[8:15]</strong> and afterwards do the Levites come in to serve the tent of meeting, and thou hast cleansed them, and hast waved them &ndash; a wave-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[8:16]</strong> `For they are certainly given to Me out of the midst of the sons of Israel, instead of him who openeth any womb &ndash; the first-born of all &ndash; from the sons of Israel I have taken them to Myself;</p>
<p><strong>[8:17]</strong> for Mine `is&rsquo; every first-born among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; in the day of my smiting every first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself;</p>
<p><strong>[8:18]</strong> and I take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel:</p>
<p><strong>[8:19]</strong> `And I give the Levites gifts to Aaron and to his sons, from the midst of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the sons of Israel, and there is no plague among the sons of Israel in the sons of Israel&rsquo;s drawing nigh unto the sanctuary.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[8:20]</strong> And Moses doth &ndash; Aaron also, and all the company of the sons of Israel &ndash; to the Levites according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses concerning the Levites; so have the sons of Israel done to them.</p>
<p><strong>[8:21]</strong> And the Levites cleanse themselves, and wash their garments, and Aaron waveth them a wave-offering before Jehovah, and Aaron maketh atonement for them to cleanse them,</p>
<p><strong>[8:22]</strong> and afterwards have the Levites gone in to do their service in the tent of meeting, before Aaron and before his sons; as Jehovah hath commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they have done to them.</p>
<p><strong>[8:23]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[8:24]</strong> <code>This </code>is&rsquo; that which `is&rsquo; the Levites&rsquo;: from a son of five and twenty years and upward he doth go in to serve the host in the service of the tent of meeting,</p>
<p><strong>[8:25]</strong> and from a son of fifty years he doth return from the host of the service, and doth not serve any more,</p>
<p><strong>[8:26]</strong> and he hath ministered with his brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and doth not do service; thus thou dost to the Levites concerning their charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[9:2]</strong> `Also, the sons of Israel prepare the passover in its appointed season;</p>
<p><strong>[9:3]</strong> in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances ye prepare it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:4]</strong> And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover,</p>
<p><strong>[9:5]</strong> and they prepare the passover in the first `month&rsquo;, on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.</p>
<p><strong>[9:6]</strong> And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on that day,</p>
<p><strong>[9:7]</strong> and those men say unto him, `We are defiled by the body of a man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering of Jehovah in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of Israel?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:8]</strong> And Moses saith unto them, `Stand ye, and I hear what Jehovah hath commanded concerning you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:9]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[9:10]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your generations), yet he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[9:11]</strong> in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things they eat it;</p>
<p><strong>[9:12]</strong> they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it.</p>
<p><strong>[9:13]</strong> `And the man who is clean, and hath not been on a journey, and hath ceased to prepare the passover, even that person hath been cut off from his people; because the offering of Jehovah he hath not brought near, in its appointed season, that man doth bear his sin.</p>
<p><strong>[9:14]</strong> `And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the passover, and according to its ordinance, so he doth; one statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[9:15]</strong> And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there is on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire till morning;</p>
<p><strong>[9:16]</strong> so it is continually; the cloud covereth it, also the appearance of fire by night.</p>
<p><strong>[9:17]</strong> And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud doth tabernacle, there do the sons of Israel encamp;</p>
<p><strong>[9:18]</strong> by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey, and by the command of Jehovah they encamp; all the days that the cloud doth tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.</p>
<p><strong>[9:19]</strong> And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journey not,</p>
<p><strong>[9:20]</strong> and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey.</p>
<p><strong>[9:21]</strong> And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when the cloud hath gone up in the morning, then they have journeyed; whether by day or by night, when the cloud hath gone up, then they have journeyed.</p>
<p><strong>[9:22]</strong> Whether two days, or a month, or days, in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle, to tabernacle over it, the sons of Israel encamp, and journey not; and in its being lifted up they journey;</p>
<p><strong>[9:23]</strong> by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey; the charge of Jehovah they have kept, by the command of Jehovah in the hand of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[10:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[10:2]</strong> `Make to thee two trumpets of silver; beaten work thou dost make them, and they have been to thee for the convocation of the company, and for the journeying of the camps;</p>
<p><strong>[10:3]</strong> and they have blown with them, and all the company have met together unto thee, unto the opening of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>[10:4]</strong> And if with one they blow, then have the princes, heads of the thousands of Israel, met together unto thee;</p>
<p><strong>[10:5]</strong> `And ye have blown &ndash; a shout, and the camps which are encamping eastward have journeyed.</p>
<p><strong>[10:6]</strong> `And ye have blown &ndash; a second shout, and the camps which are encamping southward have journeyed; a shout they blow for their journeys.</p>
<p><strong>[10:7]</strong> `And in the assembling of the assembly ye blow, and do not shout;</p>
<p><strong>[10:8]</strong> and sons of Aaron, the priests, blow with the trumpets; and they have been to you for a statute age-during to your generations.</p>
<p><strong>[10:9]</strong> `And when ye go into battle in your land against the adversary who is distressing you, then ye have shouted with the trumpets, and ye have been remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye have been saved from your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>[10:10]</strong> <code>And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in the beginnings of your months, ye have blown also with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and they have been to you for a memorial before your God; I, Jehovah, </code>am&rsquo; your God.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:11]</strong> And it cometh to pass &ndash; in the second year, in the second month, in the twentieth of the month &ndash; the cloud hath gone up from off the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
<p><strong>[10:12]</strong> and the sons of Israel journey in their journeyings from the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud doth tabernacle in the wilderness of Paran;</p>
<p><strong>[10:13]</strong> and they journey at first, by the command of Jehovah, in the hand of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[10:14]</strong> And the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah journeyeth in the first <code>place', by their hosts, and over its host </code>is&rsquo; Nahshon son of Amminadab.</p>

<p><strong>[10:25]</strong> And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan hath journeyed (rearward to all the camps), by their hosts, and over its host `is&rsquo; Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.</p>
<p><strong>[10:26]</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher `is&rsquo; Pagiel son of Ocran.</p>
<p><strong>[10:27]</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali `is&rsquo; Ahira son of Enan.</p>
<p><strong>[10:28]</strong> These `are&rsquo; journeyings of the sons of Israel by their hosts &ndash; and they journey.</p>
<p><strong>[10:29]</strong> And Moses saith to Hobab son of Raguel the Midianite, father-in-law of Moses, `We are journeying unto the place of which Jehovah hath said, I give it to you; go with us, and we have done good to thee; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:30]</strong> And he saith unto him, `I do not go; but unto my land and unto my kindred do I go.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:31]</strong> And he saith, `I pray thee, forsake us not, because thou hast known our encamping in the wilderness, and thou hast been to us for eyes;</p>
<p><strong>[10:32]</strong> and it hath come to pass when thou goest with us, yea, it hath come to pass &ndash; that good which Jehovah doth kindly with us &ndash; it we have done kindly to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:33]</strong> And they journey from the mount of Jehovah a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is journeying before them the journey of three days, to spy out for them a resting-place;</p>
<p><strong>[10:34]</strong> and the cloud of Jehovah `is&rsquo; on them by day, in their journeying from the camp.</p>
<p><strong>[10:35]</strong> And it cometh to pass in the journeying of the ark, that Moses saith, `Rise, O Jehovah, and Thine enemies are scattered, and those hating Thee flee from Thy presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[10:36]</strong> And in its resting he saith, <code>Return, O Jehovah, </code>to&rsquo; the myriads, the thousands of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:1]</strong> And the people is evil, as those sighing habitually in the ears of Jehovah, and Jehovah heareth, and His anger burneth, and the fire of Jehovah burneth among them, and consumeth in the extremity of the camp.</p>
<p><strong>[11:2]</strong> And the people cry unto Moses, and Moses prayeth unto Jehovah, and the fire is quenched;</p>
<p><strong>[11:3]</strong> and he calleth the name of that place Taberah, for the fire of Jehovah hath `burned&rsquo; among them.</p>
<p><strong>[11:4]</strong> And the rabble who <code>are' in its midst have lusted greatly, and the sons of Israel also turn back and weep, and say, </code>Who doth give us flesh?</p>
<p><strong>[11:5]</strong> We have remembered the fish which we do eat in Egypt for nought, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick;</p>
<p><strong>[11:6]</strong> and now our soul `is&rsquo; dry, there is not anything, save the manna, before our eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:7]</strong> And the manna is as coriander seed, and its aspect as the aspect of bdolach;</p>
<p><strong>[11:8]</strong> the people have turned aside and gathered <code>it', and ground </code>it&rsquo; with millstones, or beat <code>it' in a mortar, and boiled </code>it&rsquo; in a pan, and made it cakes, and its taste hath been as the taste of the moisture of oil.</p>
<p><strong>[11:9]</strong> And in the descending of the dew on the camp by night, the manna descendeth upon it.</p>
<p><strong>[11:10]</strong> And Moses heareth the people weeping by its families, each at the opening of his tent, and the anger of Jehovah burneth exceedingly, and in the eyes of Moses `it is&rsquo; evil.</p>
<p><strong>[11:11]</strong> And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Why hast Thou done evil to Thy servant? and why have I not found grace in Thine eyes &ndash; to put the burden of all this people upon me?</p>
<p><strong>[11:12]</strong> I &ndash; have I conceived all this people? I &ndash; have I begotten it, that Thou sayest unto me, Carry it in thy bosom as the nursing father beareth the suckling, unto the ground which Thou hast sworn to its fathers?</p>
<p><strong>[11:13]</strong> Whence have I flesh to give to all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give to us flesh, and we eat.</p>
<p><strong>[11:14]</strong> I am not able &ndash; I alone &ndash; to bear all this people, for `it is&rsquo; too heavy for me;</p>
<p><strong>[11:15]</strong> and if thus Thou art doing to me &ndash; slay me, I pray Thee; slay, if I have found grace in thine eyes, and let me not look on mine affliction.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:16]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou hast known that they are elders of the people, and its authorities; and thou hast taken them unto the tent of meeting, and they have stationed themselves there with thee,</p>
<p><strong>[11:17]</strong> and I have come down and spoken with thee there, and have kept back of the Spirit which <code>is' upon thee, and have put on them, and they have borne with thee some of the burden of the people, and thou dost not bear </code>it&rsquo; thyself alone.</p>
<p><strong>[11:18]</strong> <code>And unto the people thou dost say, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow, and ye have eaten flesh (for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who doth give us flesh? for we </code>had&rsquo; good in Egypt) &ndash; and Jehovah hath given to you flesh, and ye have eaten.</p>
<p><strong>[11:19]</strong> Ye do not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days; &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[11:20]</strong> unto a month of days, till that it come out from your nostrils, and it hath become to you an abomination; because that ye have loathed Jehovah, who `is&rsquo; in your midst, and weep before Him, saying, Why is this? &ndash; we have come out of Egypt!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:21]</strong> And Moses saith, <code>Six hundred thousand footmen </code>are&rsquo; the people in whose midst I `am&rsquo;; and Thou, Thou hast said, Flesh I give to them, and they have eaten, a month of days!</p>
<p><strong>[11:22]</strong> Is flock and herd slaughtered for them, that one hath found for them? &ndash; are all the fishes of the sea gathered for them &ndash; that one hath found for them?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:23]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Is the hand of Jehovah become short? now thou dost see whether My word meeteth thee or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:24]</strong> And Moses goeth out, and speaketh unto the people the words of Jehovah, and gathereth seventy men of the elders of the people, and causeth them to stand round about the tent,</p>
<p><strong>[11:25]</strong> and Jehovah cometh down in the cloud, and speaketh unto him, and keepeth back of the Spirit which `is&rsquo; on him, and putteth on the seventy men of the elders; and it cometh to pass at the resting of the Spirit on them, that they prophesy, and do not cease.</p>
<p><strong>[11:26]</strong> And two of the men are left in the camp, the name of the one `is&rsquo; Eldad, and the name of the second Medad, and the spirit resteth upon them, (and they are among those written, and have not gone out to the tent), and they prophesy in the camp;</p>
<p><strong>[11:27]</strong> and the young man runneth, and declareth to Moses, and saith, `Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:28]</strong> And Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, <code>one' of his young men, answereth and saith, </code>My lord Moses, restrain them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:29]</strong> And Moses saith to him, `Art thou zealous for me? O that all Jehovah&rsquo;s people were prophets! that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[11:30]</strong> And Moses is gathered unto the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[11:31]</strong> And a spirit hath journeyed from Jehovah, and cutteth off quails from the sea, and leaveth by the camp, as a day&rsquo;s journey here, and as a day&rsquo;s journey there, round about the camp, and about two cubits, on the face of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[11:32]</strong> And the people rise all that day, and all the night, and all the day after, and gather the quails &ndash; he who hath least hath gathered ten homers &ndash; and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp.</p>
<p><strong>[11:33]</strong> The flesh is yet between their teeth &ndash; it is not yet cut off &ndash; and the anger of Jehovah hath burned among the people, and Jehovah smiteth among the people &ndash; a very great smiting;</p>
<p><strong>[11:34]</strong> and `one&rsquo; calleth the name of that place Kibroth-Hattaavah, for there they have buried the people who lust.</p>
<p><strong>[11:35]</strong> From Kibroth-Hattaavah have the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they are in Hazeroth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:1]</strong> And Miriam speaketh &ndash; Aaron also &ndash; against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken: for a Cushite woman he had taken;</p>
<p><strong>[12:2]</strong> and they say, `Only by Moses hath Jehovah spoken? also by us hath he not spoken?&rsquo; and Jehovah heareth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:3]</strong> And the man Moses <code>is' very humble, more than any of the men who </code>are&rsquo; on the face of the ground.</p>
<p><strong>[12:4]</strong> And Jehovah saith suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, `Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting;&rsquo; and they three come out.</p>
<p><strong>[12:5]</strong> And Jehovah cometh down in the pillar of the cloud, and standeth at the opening of the tent, and calleth Aaron and Miriam, and they come out both of them.</p>
<p><strong>[12:6]</strong> And He saith, `Hear, I pray you, My words: If your prophet is of Jehovah &ndash; in an appearance unto him I make Myself known; in a dream I speak with him;</p>
<p><strong>[12:7]</strong> not so My servant Moses; in all My house he `is&rsquo; stedfast;</p>
<p><strong>[12:8]</strong> mouth unto mouth I speak with him, and `by&rsquo; an appearance, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah he beholdeth attentively; and wherefore have ye not been afraid to speak against My servant &ndash; against Moses?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[12:9]</strong> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against them, and He goeth on,</p>
<p><strong>[12:10]</strong> and the cloud hath turned aside from off the tent, and lo, Miriam `is&rsquo; leprous as snow; and Aaron turneth unto Miriam, and lo, leprous!</p>
<p><strong>[12:11]</strong> And Aaron saith unto Moses, <code>O, my lord, I pray thee, lay not upon us sin </code>in&rsquo; which we have been foolish, and `in&rsquo; which we have sinned;</p>
<p><strong>[12:12]</strong> let her not, I pray thee, be as `one&rsquo; dead, when in his coming out from the womb of his mother &ndash; the half of his flesh is consumed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[12:13]</strong> And Moses crieth unto Jehovah, saying, `O God, I pray Thee, give, I pray Thee, healing to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[12:14]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `And her father had but spat in her face &ndash; is she not ashamed seven days? she is shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterwards she is gathered.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[12:15]</strong> And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people hath not journeyed till Miriam is gathered;</p>
<p><strong>[12:16]</strong> and afterwards have the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and they encamp in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p><strong>[13:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[13:2]</strong> `Send for thee men, and they spy the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel; one man, one man for the tribe of his fathers ye do send, every one a prince among them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[13:3]</strong> And Moses sendeth them from the wilderness of Paran by the command of Jehovah; all of them `are&rsquo; men, heads of the sons of Israel they are,</p>
<p><strong>[13:4]</strong> and these their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur.</p>
<p><strong>[13:5]</strong> For the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori.</p>
<p><strong>[13:6]</strong> For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.</p>
<p><strong>[13:7]</strong> For the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>[13:8]</strong> For the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea, son of Nun.</p>
<p><strong>[13:9]</strong> For the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu.</p>
<p><strong>[13:10]</strong> For the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi.</p>
<p><strong>[13:11]</strong> For the tribe of Joseph, (for the tribe of Manasseh,) Gaddi son of Susi.</p>
<p><strong>[13:12]</strong> For the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli.</p>
<p><strong>[13:13]</strong> For the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael.</p>
<p><strong>[13:14]</strong> For the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vopshi.</p>
<p><strong>[13:15]</strong> For the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.</p>
<p><strong>[13:16]</strong> These `are&rsquo; the names of the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land; and Moses calleth Hoshea son of Nun, Jehoshua.</p>
<p><strong>[13:17]</strong> And Moses sendeth them to spy the land of Canaan, and saith unto them, <code>Go ye up this </code>way&rsquo; into the south, and ye have gone up the mountain,</p>
<p><strong>[13:18]</strong> and have seen the land what it <code>is', and the people which is dwelling on it, whether it </code>is&rsquo; strong or feeble; whether it `is&rsquo; few or many;</p>
<p><strong>[13:19]</strong> and what the land <code>is' in which it is dwelling, whether it </code>is&rsquo; good or bad; and what `are&rsquo; the cities in which it is dwelling, whether in camps or in fortresses;</p>
<p><strong>[13:20]</strong> And what the land <code>is', whether it </code>is&rsquo; fat or lean; whether there is wood in it or not; and ye have strengthened yourselves, and have taken of the fruit of the land;&rsquo; and the days `are&rsquo; days of the first-fruits of grapes.</p>
<p><strong>[13:21]</strong> And they go up and spy the land, from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob at the going in to Hamath;</p>
<p><strong>[13:22]</strong> and they go up by the south, and come in unto Hebron, and there `are&rsquo; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak (and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt),</p>
<p><strong>[13:23]</strong> and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down thence a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they bear it on a staff by two, also `some&rsquo; of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p>
<p><strong>[13:24]</strong> That place hath `one&rsquo; called Brook of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from thence.</p>
<p><strong>[13:25]</strong> And they turn back from spying the land at the end of forty days.</p>
<p><strong>[13:26]</strong> And they go and come in unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they bring them and all the company back word, and shew them the fruit of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[13:27]</strong> And they recount to him, and say, <code>We came in unto the land whither thou hast sent us, and also it </code>is&rsquo; flowing with milk and honey &ndash; and this `is&rsquo; its fruit;</p>
<p><strong>[13:28]</strong> only, surely the people which is dwelling in the land `is&rsquo; strong; and the cities are fenced, very great; and also children of Anak we have seen there.</p>
<p><strong>[13:29]</strong> Amalek is dwelling in the land of the south, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite is dwelling in the hill country, and the Canaanite is dwelling by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[13:30]</strong> And Caleb stilleth the people concerning Moses, and saith, `Let us certainly go up &ndash; and we have possessed it; for we are thoroughly able for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[13:31]</strong> And the men who have gone up with him said, <code>We are not able to go up against the people, for it </code>is&rsquo; stronger than we;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[13:32]</strong> and they bring out an evil account of the land which they have spied unto the sons of Israel, saying, <code>The land into which we passed over to spy it, is a land eating up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in its midst </code>are&rsquo; men of stature;</p>
<p><strong>[13:33]</strong> and there we saw the Nephilim, sons of Anak, of the Nephilim; and we are in our own eyes as grasshoppers; and so we were in their eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:1]</strong> And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice, and the people weep during that night;</p>
<p><strong>[14:2]</strong> and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses, and against Aaron, and all the company say unto them, `O that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, O that we had died!</p>
<p><strong>[14:3]</strong> and why is Jehovah bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:4]</strong> And they say one unto another, `Let us appoint a head, and turn back to Egypt.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:5]</strong> And Moses falleth &ndash; Aaron also &ndash; on their faces, before all the assembly of the company of the sons of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[14:6]</strong> And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of those spying the land, have rent their garments,</p>
<p><strong>[14:7]</strong> and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, <code>The land into which we have passed over to spy it, </code>is&rsquo; a very very good land;</p>
<p><strong>[14:8]</strong> if Jehovah hath delighted in us, then He hath brought us in unto this land, and hath given it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey;</p>
<p><strong>[14:9]</strong> only, against Jehovah rebel not ye: and ye, fear not ye the people of the land, for our bread they <code>are'; their defence hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; with us; fear them not.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:10]</strong> And all the company say to stone them with stones, and the honour of Jehovah hath appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the sons of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[14:11]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Until when doth this people despise Me? and until when do they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its midst?</p>
<p><strong>[14:12]</strong> I smite it with pestilence, and dispossess it, and make thee become a nation greater and mightier than it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:13]</strong> And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Then have the Egyptians heard! for Thou hast brought up with Thy power this people out of their midst,</p>
<p><strong>[14:14]</strong> and they have said <code>it' unto the inhabitant of this land, they have heard that Thou, Jehovah, </code>art&rsquo; in the midst of this people, that eye to eye Thou art seen &ndash; O Jehovah, and Thy cloud is standing over them, &ndash; and in a pillar of cloud Thou art going before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>
<p><strong>[14:15]</strong> `And Thou hast put to death this people as one man, and the nations who have heard Thy fame have spoken, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[14:16]</strong> From Jehovah&rsquo;s want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He hath sworn to them &ndash; He doth slaughter them in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>[14:17]</strong> `And now, let, I pray Thee, the power of my Lord be great, as Thou hast spoken, saying:</p>
<p><strong>[14:18]</strong> Jehovah <code>is' slow to anger, and of great kindness; bearing away iniquity and transgression, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third </code>generation&rsquo;, and on a fourth; &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[14:19]</strong> forgive, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Thy kindness, and as Thou hast borne with this people from Egypt, even until now.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:20]</strong> And Jehovah saith, `I have forgiven, according to thy word;</p>
<p><strong>[14:21]</strong> and yet, I live &ndash; and it is filled &ndash; the whole earth &ndash; `with&rsquo; the honour of Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[14:22]</strong> for all the men who are seeing My honour, and My signs, which I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and try Me these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[14:23]</strong> they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers, yea, none of those despising Me see it;</p>
<p><strong>[14:24]</strong> and My servant Caleb, because there hath been another spirit with him, and he is fully after Me &ndash; I have brought him in unto the land whither he hath entered, and his seed doth possess it.</p>
<p><strong>[14:25]</strong> `And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness &ndash; the way of the Red Sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:26]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[14:27]</strong> `Until when hath this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;</p>
<p><strong>[14:28]</strong> say unto them, I live &ndash; an affirmation of Jehovah &ndash; if, as ye have spoken in Mine ears &ndash; so I do not to you;</p>
<p><strong>[14:29]</strong> in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years and upward, who have murmured against Me;</p>
<p><strong>[14:30]</strong> ye &ndash; ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.</p>
<p><strong>[14:31]</strong> `As to your infants &ndash; of whom ye have said, A spoil they are become &ndash; I have even brought them in, and they have known the land which ye have kicked against;</p>
<p><strong>[14:32]</strong> as to you &ndash; your carcases do fall in this wilderness,</p>
<p><strong>[14:33]</strong> and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in the wilderness;</p>
<p><strong>[14:34]</strong> by the number of the days `in&rsquo; which ye spied the land, forty days, &ndash; a day for a year, a day for a year &ndash; ye do bear your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking off;</p>
<p><strong>[14:35]</strong> I `am&rsquo; Jehovah, I have spoken; if I do not this to all this evil company who are meeting against me; &ndash; in this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:36]</strong> And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land, and they turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by bringing out an evil account concerning the land,</p>
<p><strong>[14:37]</strong> even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[14:38]</strong> and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have lived of those men who go to spy out the land.</p>
<p><strong>[14:39]</strong> And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,</p>
<p><strong>[14:40]</strong> and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top of the mountain, saying, <code>Here we </code>are&rsquo;, and we have come up unto the place which Jehovah hath spoken of, for we have sinned.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:41]</strong> And Moses saith, <code>Why </code>is&rsquo; this? &ndash; ye are transgressing the command of Jehovah, and it doth not prosper;</p>
<p><strong>[14:42]</strong> go not up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies;</p>
<p><strong>[14:43]</strong> for the Amalekite and the Canaanite `are&rsquo; there before you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah is not with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[14:44]</strong> And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses have not departed out of the midst of the camp.</p>
<p><strong>[14:45]</strong> And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down &ndash; unto Hormah.</p>
<p><strong>[15:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[15:2]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,</p>
<p><strong>[15:3]</strong> then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or free-will-offering, or in your appointed things, to make a sweet fragrance to Jehovah, out of the herd, or out of the flock.</p>
<p><strong>[15:4]</strong> `And he who is bringing near his offering to Jehovah hath brought near a present of flour, a tenth deal, mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil;</p>
<p><strong>[15:5]</strong> and wine for a libation, a fourth of the hin thou dost prepare for the burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, for the one lamb;</p>
<p><strong>[15:6]</strong> or for a ram thou dost prepare a present of flour, two-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a third of the hin;</p>
<p><strong>[15:7]</strong> and wine for a libation, a third part of the hin, thou dost bring near &ndash; a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[15:8]</strong> `And when thou makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or peace-offerings to Jehovah,</p>
<p><strong>[15:9]</strong> then he hath brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour, three-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a half of the hin;</p>
<p><strong>[15:10]</strong> and wine thou bringest near for a libation, a half of the hin &ndash; a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[15:11]</strong> thus it is done for the one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep or of the goats.</p>
<p><strong>[15:12]</strong> `According to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to each, according to their number;</p>
<p><strong>[15:13]</strong> every native doth thus with these, at bringing near a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[15:14]</strong> and when a sojourner sojourneth with you, or whoso `is&rsquo; in your midst to your generations, and he hath made a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah, as ye do so he doth.</p>
<p><strong>[15:15]</strong> <code>One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning, a statute age-during to your generations: as ye </code>are&rsquo; so is the sojourner before Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[15:16]</strong> one law and one ordinance is to you and to the sojourner who is sojourning with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[15:17]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[15:18]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, In your coming in unto the land whither I am bringing you in,</p>
<p><strong>[15:19]</strong> then it hath been, in your eating of the bread of the land, ye heave up a heave-offering to Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[15:20]</strong> the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up &ndash; a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of a threshing-floor, so ye do heave it.</p>
<p><strong>[15:21]</strong> Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Jehovah a heave-offering &ndash; to your generations.</p>
<p><strong>[15:22]</strong> `And when ye err, and do not all these commands which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,</p>
<p><strong>[15:23]</strong> the whole that Jehovah hath charged upon you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Jehovah hath commanded, and henceforth, to your generations,</p>
<p><strong>[15:24]</strong> then it hath been, if from the eyes of the company it hath been done in ignorance, that all the company have prepared one bullock, a son of the herd, for a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah, and its present, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.</p>
<p><strong>[15:25]</strong> <code>And the priest hath made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel, and it hath been forgiven them, for it </code>is&rsquo; ignorance, and they &ndash; they have brought in their offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, even their sin-offering before Jehovah for their ignorance;</p>
<p><strong>[15:26]</strong> and it hath been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst; for to all the company `it is done&rsquo; in ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>[15:27]</strong> `And if one person sin in ignorance, then he hath brought near a she-goat, daughter of a year, for a sin-offering;</p>
<p><strong>[15:28]</strong> and the priest hath made atonement for the person who is erring, in his sinning in ignorance before Jehovah, by making atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him;</p>
<p><strong>[15:29]</strong> for the native among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst &ndash; one law is to you, for him who is doing `anything&rsquo; through ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>[15:30]</strong> <code>And the person who doth </code>aught&rsquo; with a high hand &ndash; of the native or of the sojourner &ndash; Jehovah he is reviling, and that person hath been cut off from the midst of his people;</p>
<p><strong>[15:31]</strong> because the word of Jehovah he despised, and His command hath broken &ndash; that person is certainly cut off; his iniquity `is&rsquo; on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[15:32]</strong> And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness, and they find a man gathering wood on the sabbath-day,</p>
<p><strong>[15:33]</strong> and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company,</p>
<p><strong>[15:34]</strong> and they place him in ward, for it <code>is' not explained what is </code>to be&rsquo; done to him.</p>
<p><strong>[15:35]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The man is certainly put to death, all the company stoning him with stones, at the outside of the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[15:36]</strong> And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones, and he dieth, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[15:37]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[15:38]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, and they have made for themselves fringes on the skirts of their garments, to their generations, and they have put on the fringe of the skirt a ribbon of blue,</p>
<p><strong>[15:39]</strong> and it hath been to you for a fringe, and ye have seen it, and have remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and have done them, and ye search not after your heart, and after your eyes, after which ye are going a-whoring;</p>
<p><strong>[15:40]</strong> so that ye remember and have done all My commands, and ye have been holy to your God;</p>
<p><strong>[15:41]</strong> I <code>am' Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt to become your God; I, Jehovah, </code>am&rsquo; your God.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:1]</strong> And Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, taketh both Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben,</p>
<p><strong>[16:2]</strong> and they rise up before Moses, with men of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty, princes of the company, called of the convention, men of name,</p>
<p><strong>[16:3]</strong> and they are assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and say unto them, <code>Enough of you! for all the company -- all of them </code>are&rsquo; holy, and in their midst `is&rsquo; Jehovah; and wherefore do ye lift yourselves up above the assembly of Jehovah?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:4]</strong> And Moses heareth, and falleth on his face,</p>
<p><strong>[16:5]</strong> and he speaketh unto Korah, and unto all his company, saying, `Morning! &ndash; and Jehovah is knowing those who are his, and him who is holy, and hath brought near unto Him; even him whom He doth fix on He bringeth near unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>[16:6]</strong> This do: take to yourselves censers, Korah, and all his company,</p>
<p><strong>[16:7]</strong> and put in them fire, and put on them perfume, before Jehovah to-morrow, and it hath been, the man whom Jehovah chooseth, he `is&rsquo; the holy one; &ndash; enough of you, sons of Levi.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:8]</strong> And Moses saith unto Korah, `Hear ye, I pray you, sons of Levi;</p>
<p><strong>[16:9]</strong> is it little to you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the company of Israel to bring you near unto Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the company to serve them? &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[16:10]</strong> yea, He doth bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee &ndash; and ye have sought also the priesthood!</p>
<p><strong>[16:11]</strong> Therefore, thou and all thy company who are met <code>are' against Jehovah; and Aaron, what </code>is&rsquo; he, that ye murmur against him?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:12]</strong> And Moses sendeth to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons of Eliab, and they say, `We do not come up;</p>
<p><strong>[16:13]</strong> is it little that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in a wilderness that thou also certainly makest thyself prince over us?</p>
<p><strong>[16:14]</strong> Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey thou hast not brought us in, nor dost thou give to us an inheritance of field and vineyard; the eyes of these men dost thou pick out? we do not come up.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:15]</strong> And it is very displeasing to Moses, and he saith unto Jehovah, `Turn not Thou unto their present; not one ass from them have I taken, nor have I afflicted one of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:16]</strong> And Moses saith unto Korah, `Thou and all thy company, be ye before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;</p>
<p><strong>[16:17]</strong> and take ye each his censer, and ye have put on them perfume, and brought near before Jehovah, each his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; and thou and Aaron, each his censer.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:18]</strong> And they take each his censer, and put on them fire, and lay on them perfume, and they stand at the opening of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>[16:19]</strong> And Korah assembleth against them all the company unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the honour of Jehovah is seen by all the company.</p>
<p><strong>[16:20]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[16:21]</strong> `Be ye separated from the midst of this company, and I consume them in a moment;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:22]</strong> and they fall on their faces, and say, `God, God of the spirits of all flesh &ndash; the one man sinneth, and against all the company Thou art wroth!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:23]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[16:24]</strong> `Speak unto the company, saying, Go ye up from round about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:25]</strong> And Moses riseth, and goeth unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel go after him,</p>
<p><strong>[16:26]</strong> and he speaketh unto the company, saying, `Turn aside, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and come not against anything that they have, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:27]</strong> And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, from round about, and Dathan, and Abiram have come out, standing at the opening of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their infants.</p>
<p><strong>[16:28]</strong> And Moses saith, <code>By this ye do know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works, that </code>they are&rsquo; not from my own heart;</p>
<p><strong>[16:29]</strong> if according to the death of all men these die &ndash; or the charge of all men is charged upon them &ndash; Jehovah hath not sent me;</p>
<p><strong>[16:30]</strong> and if a strange thing Jehovah do, and the ground hath opened her mouth and swallowed them, and all that they have, and they have gone down alive to Sheol &ndash; then ye have known that these men have despised Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:31]</strong> And it cometh to pass at his finishing speaking all these words, that the ground which `is&rsquo; under them cleaveth,</p>
<p><strong>[16:32]</strong> and the earth openeth her mouth, and swalloweth them, and their houses, and all the men who `are&rsquo; for Korah, and all the goods,</p>
<p><strong>[16:33]</strong> and they go down, they, and all that they have, alive to Sheol, and the earth closeth over them, and they perish from the midst of the assembly;</p>
<p><strong>[16:34]</strong> and all Israel who <code>are' round about them have fled at their voice, for they said, </code>Lest the earth swallow us;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:35]</strong> and fire hath come out from Jehovah, and consumeth the two hundred and fifty men bringing near the perfume.</p>
<p><strong>[16:36]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[16:37]</strong> `Say unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, and he lifteth up the censers from the midst of the burning, and the fire scatter thou yonder, for they have been hallowed,</p>
<p><strong>[16:38]</strong> `even&rsquo; the censers of these sinners against their own souls; and they have made them spread-out plates, a covering for the altar, for they have brought them near before Jehovah, and they are hallowed; and they are become a sign to the sons of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:39]</strong> And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which they who are burnt had brought near, and they spread them out, a covering for the altar &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[16:40]</strong> a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that a stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron doth not draw near to make a perfume before Jehovah, and is not as Korah, and as his company, &ndash; as Jehovah hath spoken by the hand of Moses to him.</p>
<p><strong>[16:41]</strong> And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur, on the morrow, against Moses and against Aaron, saying, `Ye &ndash; ye have put to death the people of Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:42]</strong> And it cometh to pass, in the company being assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they turn towards the tent of meeting, and lo, the cloud hath covered it, and the honour of Jehovah is seen;</p>
<p><strong>[16:43]</strong> and Moses cometh &ndash; Aaron also &ndash; unto the front of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>[16:44]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[16:45]</strong> `Get you up from the midst of this company, and I consume them in a moment;&rsquo; and they fall on their faces,</p>
<p><strong>[16:46]</strong> and Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take the censer, and put on it fire from off the altar, and place perfume, and go, hasten unto the company, and make atonement for them, for the wrath hath gone out from the presence of Jehovah &ndash; the plague hath begun.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[16:47]</strong> And Aaron taketh as Moses hath spoken, and runneth unto the midst of the assembly, and lo, the plague hath begun among the people; and he giveth the perfume, and maketh atonement for the people,</p>
<p><strong>[16:48]</strong> and standeth between the dead and the living, and the plague is restrained;</p>
<p><strong>[16:49]</strong> and those who die by the plague are fourteen thousand and seven hundred, apart from those who die for the matter of Korah;</p>
<p><strong>[16:50]</strong> and Aaron turneth back unto Moses, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the plague hath been restrained.</p>
<p><strong>[17:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[17:2]</strong> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and take from them each a rod, for a father&rsquo;s house, from all their princes, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods; the name of each thou dost write on his rod,</p>
<p><strong>[17:3]</strong> and Aaron&rsquo;s name thou dost write on the tribe of Levi; for one rod `is&rsquo; for the head of their fathers&rsquo; house:</p>
<p><strong>[17:4]</strong> and thou hast placed them in the tent of meeting, before the testimony, where I meet with you.</p>
<p><strong>[17:5]</strong> `And it hath come to pass, the man&rsquo;s rod on whom I fix doth flourish, and I have caused to cease from off me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[17:6]</strong> And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and all their princes give unto him one rod for a prince, one rod for a prince, for their fathers&rsquo; house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron `is&rsquo; in the midst of their rods;</p>
<p><strong>[17:7]</strong> and Moses placeth the rods before Jehovah, in the tent of the testimony.</p>
<p><strong>[17:8]</strong> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Moses goeth in unto the tent of the testimony, and lo, the rod of Aaron hath flourished for the house of Levi, and is bringing out flourishing, and doth blossom blossoms, and doth produce almonds;</p>
<p><strong>[17:9]</strong> and Moses bringeth out all the rods from before Jehovah, unto all the sons of Israel, and they look, and take each his rod.</p>
<p><strong>[17:10]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, for a charge, for a sign to the sons of rebellion, and thou dost remove their murmurings from off me, and they do not die;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[17:11]</strong> and Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done.</p>
<p><strong>[17:12]</strong> And the sons of Israel speak unto Moses, saying, `Lo, we have expired; we have perished; we have all of us perished;</p>
<p><strong>[17:13]</strong> any who is at all drawing near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah dieth; have we not been consumed &ndash; to expire?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[18:1]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy father with thee, do bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou, and thy sons with thee, do bear the iniquity of your priesthood;</p>
<p><strong>[18:2]</strong> and also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring near with thee, and they are joined unto thee, and serve thee, even thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of the testimony.</p>
<p><strong>[18:3]</strong> `And they have kept thy charge, and the charge of all the tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or you;</p>
<p><strong>[18:4]</strong> and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger doth not come near unto you;</p>
<p><strong>[18:5]</strong> and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the sons of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[18:6]</strong> `And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting;</p>
<p><strong>[18:7]</strong> and thou, and thy sons with thee, do keep your priesthood, for everything of the altar, and within the vail, and ye have served; a service of gift I make your priesthood; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[18:8]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I, lo, I have given to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel &ndash; to thee I have given them for the anointing, and to thy sons, by a statute age-during.</p>
<p><strong>[18:9]</strong> This is thine of the most holy things, from the fire: all their offering, to all their present, and to all their sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to thy sons;</p>
<p><strong>[18:10]</strong> in the holy of holies thou dost eat it; every male doth eat it; holy it is to thee.</p>
<p><strong>[18:11]</strong> <code>And this </code>is&rsquo; thine: the heave-offering of their gift, to all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, to thee I have given them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;</p>
<p><strong>[18:12]</strong> all the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and wheat &ndash; their first-`fruits&rsquo; which they give to Jehovah &ndash; to thee I have given them.</p>
<p><strong>[18:13]</strong> <code>The first-fruits of all that </code>is&rsquo; in their land, which they bring in to Jehovah, are thine; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;</p>
<p><strong>[18:14]</strong> every devoted thing in Israel is thine,</p>
<p><strong>[18:15]</strong> every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring near to Jehovah, among man and among beast, is thine; only, thou dost certainly ransom the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean beast thou dost ransom.</p>
<p><strong>[18:16]</strong> <code>And their ransomed ones from a son of a month, thou dost ransom with thy valuation, of silver, five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs it </code>is&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>[18:17]</strong> <code>Only, the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou dost not ransom, holy they </code>are&rsquo;: their blood thou dost sprinkle on the altar, and of their fat thou makest perfume, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah,</p>
<p><strong>[18:18]</strong> and their flesh is thine, as the breast of the wave-offering, and as the right leg, it is thine;</p>
<p><strong>[18:19]</strong> all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Jehovah I have given to thee and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during, a covenant of salt, age-during it `is&rsquo; before Jehovah, to thee and to thy seed with thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[18:20]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, <code>In their land thou dost not inherit, and a portion thou hast not in their midst: I </code>am&rsquo; thy portion, and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[18:21]</strong> and to the sons of Levi, lo, I have given all the tenth in Israel for inheritance in exchange for their service which they are serving &ndash; the service of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>[18:22]</strong> `And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of meeting, to bear sin, to die,</p>
<p><strong>[18:23]</strong> and the Levites have done the service of the tent of meeting, and they &ndash; they bear their iniquity; a statute age-during to your generations, that in the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance;</p>
<p><strong>[18:24]</strong> but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Jehovah, a heave-offering, I have given to the Levites for inheritance; therefore I have said of them, In the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[18:25]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[18:26]</strong> `And unto the Levites thou dost speak; and thou hast said unto them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given to you from them, for your inheritance, then ye have lifted up from it the heave-offering of Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe;</p>
<p><strong>[18:27]</strong> and your heave-offering hath been reckoned to you as corn from the threshing-floor, and as fulness from the wine-vat;</p>
<p><strong>[18:28]</strong> so ye do lift up &ndash; ye also &ndash; the heave-offering of Jehovah from all your tithes which ye receive from the sons of Israel; and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Jehovah to Aaron the priest;</p>
<p><strong>[18:29]</strong> out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole heave-offering of Jehovah; out of all its fat, &ndash; its hallowed part &ndash; out of it.</p>
<p><strong>[18:30]</strong> `And thou hast said unto them, In your lifting up its fat out of it, then it hath been reckoned to the Levites, as increase of a threshing-floor, and as increase of a wine-vat;</p>
<p><strong>[18:31]</strong> and ye have eaten it in every place, ye and your households, for it `is&rsquo; your hire in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting;</p>
<p><strong>[18:32]</strong> and ye bear no sin for it, in your lifting up its fat out of it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye do not pollute, and ye die not.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[19:1]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[19:2]</strong> <code>This </code>is&rsquo; a statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee a red cow, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish, on which no yoke hath gone up;</p>
<p><strong>[19:3]</strong> and ye have given it unto Eleazar the priest, and he hath brought it out unto the outside of the camp, and hath slaughtered it before him.</p>
<p><strong>[19:4]</strong> `And Eleazar the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger, and hath sprinkled over-against the front of the tent of meeting of her blood seven times;</p>
<p><strong>[19:5]</strong> and `one&rsquo; hath burnt the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, besides her dung, he doth burn;</p>
<p><strong>[19:6]</strong> and the priest hath taken cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and hath cast unto the midst of the burning of the cow;</p>
<p><strong>[19:7]</strong> and the priest hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards doth come in unto the camp, and the priest is unclean till the evening;</p>
<p><strong>[19:8]</strong> and he who is burning it doth wash his garments with water, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and is unclean till the evening.</p>
<p><strong>[19:9]</strong> <code>And a clean man hath gathered the ashes of the cow, and hath placed at the outside of the camp, in a clean place, and it hath become to the company of the sons of Israel a charge for waters of separation -- it </code>is&rsquo; a `cleansing&rsquo;;</p>
<p><strong>[19:10]</strong> and he who is gathering the ashes of the heifer hath washed his garments, and is unclean till the evening; and it hath been to the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst, for a statute age-during.</p>
<p><strong>[19:11]</strong> `He who is coming against the dead body of any man &ndash; is unclean seven days;</p>
<p><strong>[19:12]</strong> he doth cleanse himself for it on the third day, and on the seventh day he is clean; and if he cleanse not himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he is not clean.</p>
<p><strong>[19:13]</strong> Any one who is coming against the dead, against the body of man who dieth, and cleanseth not himself &ndash; the tabernacle of Jehovah he hath defiled, and that person hath been cut off from Israel, for water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness `is&rsquo; still upon him.</p>
<p><strong>[19:14]</strong> <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the law, when a man dieth in a tent: every one who is coming in unto the tent, and all that `is&rsquo; in the tent, is unclean seven days;</p>
<p><strong>[19:15]</strong> and every open vessel which hath no covering of thread upon it is unclean.</p>
<p><strong>[19:16]</strong> `And every one who cometh, on the face of the field, against the pierced of a sword, or against the dead, or against a bone of man, or against a grave, is unclean seven days;</p>
<p><strong>[19:17]</strong> and they have taken for the unclean person of the ashes of the burning of the `cleansing&rsquo;, and he hath put upon it running water unto a vessel;</p>
<p><strong>[19:18]</strong> and a clean person hath taken hyssop, and hath dipped `it&rsquo; in water, and hath sprinkled on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who have been there, and on him who is coming against a bone, or against one pierced, or against the dead, or against a grave.</p>
<p><strong>[19:19]</strong> <code>And the clean hath sprinkled </code>it&rsquo; on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day, and hath cleansed him on the seventh day, and he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and hath been clean in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>[19:20]</strong> <code>And the man who is unclean, and doth not cleanse himself, even that person hath been cut off from the midst of the assembly; for the sanctuary of Jehovah he hath defiled; water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he </code>is&rsquo; unclean.</p>
<p><strong>[19:21]</strong> `And it hath been to them for a statute age-during, that he who is sprinkling the water of separation doth wash his garments, and he who is coming against the water of separation is unclean till the evening,</p>
<p><strong>[19:22]</strong> and all against which the unclean person cometh is unclean, and the person who is coming against `it&rsquo; is unclean till the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:1]</strong> And the sons of Israel come in, &ndash; all the company &ndash; to the wilderness of Zin, in the first month, and the people abide in Kadesh, and Miriam dieth there, and is buried there.</p>
<p><strong>[20:2]</strong> And there hath been no water for the company, and they are assembled against Moses, and against Aaron,</p>
<p><strong>[20:3]</strong> and the people strive with Moses, and speak, saying, `And oh that we had expired when our brethren expired before Jehovah!</p>
<p><strong>[20:4]</strong> and why have ye brought in the assembly of Jehovah unto this wilderness to die there, we and our beasts?</p>
<p><strong>[20:5]</strong> and why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? no place of seed, and fig, and vine, and pomegranate; and water there is none to drink.</p>
<p><strong>[20:6]</strong> And Moses and Aaron go in from the presence of the assembly unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and fall on their faces, and the honour of Jehovah is seen by them.</p>
<p><strong>[20:7]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[20:8]</strong> `Take the rod, and assemble the company, thou and Aaron thy brother; and ye have spoken unto the rock before their eyes, and it hath given its water, and thou hast brought out to them water from the rock, and hast watered the company, and their beasts.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:9]</strong> And Moses taketh the rod from before Jehovah, as He hath commanded him,</p>
<p><strong>[20:10]</strong> and Moses and Aaron assemble the assembly unto the front of the rock, and he saith to them, `Hear, I pray you, O rebels, from this rock do we bring out to you water?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:11]</strong> and Moses lifteth up his hand, and smiteth the rock with his rod twice; and much water cometh out, and the company drink, also their beasts.</p>
<p><strong>[20:12]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, and unto Aaron, `Because ye have not believed in Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye do not bring in this assembly unto the land which I have given to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:13]</strong> These <code>are' waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel have </code>striven&rsquo; with Jehovah, and He is sanctified upon them.</p>
<p><strong>[20:14]</strong> And Moses sendeth messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, `Thus said thy brother Israel, Thou &ndash; thou hast known all the travail which hath found us;</p>
<p><strong>[20:15]</strong> that our fathers go down to Egypt, and we dwell in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians do evil to us and to our fathers;</p>
<p><strong>[20:16]</strong> and we cry unto Jehovah, and He heareth our voice, and sendeth a messenger, and is bringing us out of Egypt; and lo, we <code>are' in Kadesh, a city </code>in&rsquo; the extremity of thy border.</p>
<p><strong>[20:17]</strong> Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land; we pass not over through a field, or through a vineyard, nor do we drink waters of a well; the way of the king we go, we turn not aside &ndash; right or left &ndash; till that we pass over thy border.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:18]</strong> And Edom saith unto him, `Thou dost not pass over through me, lest with sword I come out to meet thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:19]</strong> And the sons of Israel say unto him, `In the highway we go, and if of thy waters we drink &ndash; I and my cattle &ndash; then I have given their price; only (it is nothing) on my feet I pass over.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:20]</strong> And he saith, `Thou dost not pass over;&rsquo; and Edom cometh out to meet him with much people, and with a strong hand;</p>
<p><strong>[20:21]</strong> and Edom refuseth to suffer Israel to pass over through his border, and Israel turneth aside from off him.</p>
<p><strong>[20:22]</strong> And the sons of Israel, the whole company, journey from Kadesh, and come in unto mount Hor,</p>
<p><strong>[20:23]</strong> and Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron in mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[20:24]</strong> `Aaron is gathered unto his people, for he doth not go in unto the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because that ye provoked My mouth at the waters of Meribah.</p>
<p><strong>[20:25]</strong> `Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and cause them to go up mount Hor,</p>
<p><strong>[20:26]</strong> and strip Aaron of his garments, and thou hast clothed `with&rsquo; them Eleazar his son, and Aaron is gathered, and doth die there.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[20:27]</strong> And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded, and they go up unto mount Hor before the eyes of all the company,</p>
<p><strong>[20:28]</strong> and Moses strippeth Aaron of his garments, and clotheth with them Eleazar his son, and Aaron dieth there on the top of the mount; and Moses cometh down &ndash; Eleazar also &ndash; from the mount,</p>
<p><strong>[20:29]</strong> and all the company see that Aaron hath expired, and they bewail Aaron thirty days &ndash; all the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[21:1]</strong> And the Canaanite &ndash; king Arad &ndash; dwelling in the south, heareth that Israel hath come the way of the Atharim, and he fighteth against Israel, and taketh `some&rsquo; of them captive.</p>
<p><strong>[21:2]</strong> And Israel voweth a vow to Jehovah, and saith, `If Thou dost certainly give this people into my hand, then I have devoted their cities;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:3]</strong> and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Israel, and giveth up the Canaanite, and he devoteth them and their cities, and calleth the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p><strong>[21:4]</strong> And they journey from mount Hor, the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom, and the soul of the people is short in the way,</p>
<p><strong>[21:5]</strong> and the people speak against God, and against Moses, `Why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to die in a wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul hath been weary of this light bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:6]</strong> And Jehovah sendeth among the people the burning serpents, and they bite the people, and much people of Israel die;</p>
<p><strong>[21:7]</strong> and the people come in unto Moses and say, `We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, and He doth turn aside from us the serpent;&rsquo; and Moses prayeth in behalf of the people.</p>
<p><strong>[21:8]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, <code>Make for thee a burning </code>serpent&rsquo;, and set it on an ensign; and it hath been, every one who is bitten and hath seen it &ndash; he hath lived.</p>
<p><strong>[21:9]</strong> And Moses maketh a serpent of brass, and setteth it on the ensign, and it hath been, if the serpent hath bitten any man, and he hath looked expectingly unto the serpent of brass &ndash; he hath lived.</p>
<p><strong>[21:10]</strong> And the sons of Israel journey, and encamp in Oboth.</p>
<p><strong>[21:11]</strong> And they journey from Oboth, and encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the wilderness that `is&rsquo; on the front of Moab, at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p><strong>[21:12]</strong> From thence they have journeyed, and encamp in the valley of Zared.</p>
<p><strong>[21:13]</strong> From thence they have journeyed, and encamp beyond Arnon, which <code>is' in the wilderness which is coming out of the border of the Amorite, for Arnon </code>is&rsquo; the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorite;</p>
<p><strong>[21:14]</strong> therefore it is said in a book, <code>The wars of Jehovah,' -- </code>Waheb in Suphah, And the brooks of Arnon;</p>
<p><strong>[21:15]</strong> And the spring of the brooks, Which turned aside to the dwelling of Ar, And hath leaned to the border of Moab.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:16]</strong> And from thence <code>they journeyed' to Beer; it </code>is&rsquo; the well <code>concerning' which Jehovah said to Moses, </code>Gather the people, and I give to them &ndash; water.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:17]</strong> Then singeth Israel this song, concerning the well &ndash; they have answered to it:</p>
<p><strong>[21:18]</strong> <code>A well -- digged it have princes, Prepared it have nobles of the people, With the lawgiver, with their staves.' And from the wilderness </code>they journeyed&rsquo; to Mattanah,</p>
<p><strong>[21:19]</strong> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</p>
<p><strong>[21:20]</strong> and from Bamoth in the valley which <code>is' in the field of Moab </code>to&rsquo; the top of Pisgah, which hath looked on the front of the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>[21:21]</strong> And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorite, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[21:22]</strong> `Let me pass through thy land, we do not turn aside into a field, or into a vineyard, we do not drink waters of a well; in the king&rsquo;s way we go, till that we pass over thy border.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:23]</strong> And Sihon hath not suffered Israel to pass through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and cometh out to meet Israel into the wilderness, and cometh in to Jahaz, and fighteth against Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[21:24]</strong> And Israel smiteth him by the mouth of the sword, and possesseth his land from Arnon unto Jabbok &ndash; unto the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon `is&rsquo; strong.</p>
<p><strong>[21:25]</strong> And Israel taketh all these cities, and Israel dwelleth in all the cities of the Amorite, in Heshbon, and in all its villages;</p>
<p><strong>[21:26]</strong> for Heshbon is a city of Sihon king of the Amorite, and he hath fought against the former king of Moab, and taketh all his land out of his hand, unto Arnon;</p>
<p><strong>[21:27]</strong> therefore those using similes say &ndash; `Enter ye Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and ready,</p>
<p><strong>[21:28]</strong> For fire hath gone out from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon, It hath consumed Ar of Moab, Owners of the high places of Arnon.</p>
<p><strong>[21:29]</strong> Wo to thee, O Moab, Thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh, He hath given his sons who escape &ndash; Also his daughters &ndash; Into captivity, to a king of the Amorite &ndash; Sihon!</p>
<p><strong>[21:30]</strong> And we shoot them, Perished hath Heshbon unto Dibon, And we make desolate unto Nophah, Which `is&rsquo; unto Medeba.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:31]</strong> And Israel dwelleth in the land of the Amorite,</p>
<p><strong>[21:32]</strong> and Moses sendeth to spy out Jaazer, and they capture its villages, and dispossess the Amorite who `is&rsquo; there,</p>
<p><strong>[21:33]</strong> and turn and go up the way of Bashan, and Og king of Bashan cometh out to meet them, he and all his people, to battle, `at&rsquo; Edrei.</p>
<p><strong>[21:34]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Fear him not, for into thy hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and thou hast done to him as thou hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[21:35]</strong> And they smite him, and his sons, and all his people, until he hath not left to him a remnant, and they possess his land.</p>
<p><strong>[22:1]</strong> And the sons of Israel journey and encamp in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, `by&rsquo; Jericho.</p>
<p><strong>[22:2]</strong> And Balak son of Zippor seeth all that Israel hath done to the Amorite,</p>
<p><strong>[22:3]</strong> and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people, for it `is&rsquo; numerous; and Moab is vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[22:4]</strong> and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, <code>Now doth the assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor </code>is&rsquo; king of Moab at that time,</p>
<p><strong>[22:5]</strong> and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which <code>is' by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, </code>Lo, a people hath come out of Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is abiding over-against me;</p>
<p><strong>[22:6]</strong> and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for it `is&rsquo; mightier than I; it may be I prevail &ndash; we smite it &ndash; and I cast it out from the land; for I have known &ndash; that which thou blessest is blessed, and that which thou cursest is cursed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:7]</strong> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and speak unto him the words of Balak,</p>
<p><strong>[22:8]</strong> and he saith unto them, `Lodge here to-night, and I have brought you back word, as Jehovah speaketh unto me;&rsquo; and the princes of Moab abide with Balaam.</p>
<p><strong>[22:9]</strong> And God cometh in unto Balaam, and saith, <code>Who </code>are&rsquo; these men with thee?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:10]</strong> And Balaam saith unto God, `Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me:</p>
<p><strong>[22:11]</strong> Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth the eye of the land, &ndash; now come, pierce it for me; it may be I am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:12]</strong> and God saith unto Balaam, <code>Thou dost not go with them; thou dost not curse the people; for it </code>is&rsquo; blessed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:13]</strong> And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saith unto the princes of Balak, `Go unto your land, for Jehovah is refusing to suffer me to go with you;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:14]</strong> and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and say, `Balaam is refusing to come with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:15]</strong> And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and honoured than these,</p>
<p><strong>[22:16]</strong> and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, `Thus said Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming unto me,</p>
<p><strong>[22:17]</strong> for very greatly I honour thee, and all that thou sayest unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this people.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:18]</strong> And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak, `If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah my God, to do a little or a great thing;</p>
<p><strong>[22:19]</strong> and, now, abide, I pray you, in this `place&rsquo;, you also, to-night; and I know what Jehovah is adding to speak with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:20]</strong> And God cometh in unto Balaam, by night, and saith to him, `If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and only the thing which I speak unto thee &ndash; it thou dost do.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:21]</strong> And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and goeth with the princes of Moab,</p>
<p><strong>[22:22]</strong> and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a messenger of Jehovah stationeth himself in the way for an adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his servants `are&rsquo; with him,</p>
<p><strong>[22:23]</strong> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside out of the way, and goeth into a field, and Balaam smiteth the ass to turn it aside into the way.</p>
<p><strong>[22:24]</strong> And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards &ndash; a wall on this `side&rsquo; and a wall on that &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[22:25]</strong> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and is pressed unto the wall, and presseth Balaam&rsquo;s foot unto the wall, and he addeth to smite her;</p>
<p><strong>[22:26]</strong> and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over, and standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside &ndash; right or left &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[22:27]</strong> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and croucheth under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth the ass with a staff.</p>
<p><strong>[22:28]</strong> And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass, and she saith to Balaam, `What have I done to thee that thou hast smitten me these three times?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:29]</strong> and Balaam saith to the ass, `Because thou hast rolled thyself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for now I had slain thee;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:30]</strong> and the ass saith unto Balaam, <code>Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden since </code>I was&rsquo; thine unto this day? have I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?&rsquo; and he saith, `No.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:31]</strong> And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he seeeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and he boweth and doth obeisance, to his face;</p>
<p><strong>[22:32]</strong> and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him, <code>Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? lo, I -- I have come out for an adversary, for </code>thy&rsquo; way hath been perverse before me,</p>
<p><strong>[22:33]</strong> and the ass seeth me, and turneth aside at my presence these three times; unless she had turned aside from my presence, surely now also, thee I had slain, and her kept alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:34]</strong> And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, <code>I have sinned, for I did not know that thou </code>art&rsquo; standing to meet me in the way; and now, if evil in thine eyes &ndash; I turn back by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:35]</strong> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam, `Go with the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee &ndash; it thou dost speak;&rsquo; and Balaam goeth with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p><strong>[22:36]</strong> And Balak heareth that Balaam hath come, and goeth out to meet him, unto a city of Moab, which <code>is' on the border of Arnon, which </code>is&rsquo; in the extremity of the border;</p>
<p><strong>[22:37]</strong> and Balak saith unto Balaam, `Did I not diligently sent unto thee to call for thee? why didst thou not come unto me? am I not truly able to honour thee?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:38]</strong> And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Lo, I have come unto thee; now &ndash; am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God setteth in my mouth &ndash; it I do speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[22:39]</strong> And Balaam goeth with Balak, and they come to Kirjath-Huzoth,</p>
<p><strong>[22:40]</strong> and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sendeth to Balaam, and to the princes who `are&rsquo; with him;</p>
<p><strong>[22:41]</strong> and it cometh to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh Balaam, and causeth him to go up the high places of Baal, and he seeth from thence the extremity of the people.</p>
<p><strong>[23:1]</strong> And Balaam saith unto Balak, <code>Build for me in this </code>place&rsquo; seven altars, and make ready for me in this `place&rsquo; seven bullocks and seven rams.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:2]</strong> And Balak doth as Balaam hath spoken, and Balak &ndash; Balaam also &ndash; offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar,</p>
<p><strong>[23:3]</strong> and Balaam saith to Balak, <code>Station thyself by thy burnt-offering and I go on, it may be Jehovah doth come to meet me, and the thing which He sheweth me -- I have declared to thee;' and he goeth </code>to&rsquo; a high place.</p>
<p><strong>[23:4]</strong> And God cometh unto Balaam, and he saith unto Him, `The seven altars I have arranged, and I offer a bullock and a ram on the altar;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:5]</strong> and Jehovah putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:6]</strong> And he turneth back unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, he and all the princes of Moab.</p>
<p><strong>[23:7]</strong> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: <code>From Aram he doth lead me -- Balak king of Moab; From mountains of the east: Come -- curse for me Jacob, And come -- be indignant </code>with&rsquo; Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[23:8]</strong> What &ndash; do I pierce? &ndash; God hath not pierced! And what &ndash; am I indignant? &ndash; Jehovah hath not been indignant!</p>
<p><strong>[23:9]</strong> For from the top of rocks I see it, And from heights I behold it; Lo a people! alone it doth tabernacle, And among nations doth not reckon itself.</p>
<p><strong>[23:10]</strong> Who hath counted the dust of Jacob, And the number of the fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of upright ones, And let my last end be like his!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:11]</strong> And Balak saith unto Balaam, `What hast thou done to me? to pierce mine enemies I have taken thee &ndash; and lo, thou hast certainly blessed;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:12]</strong> and he answereth and saith, `That which Jehovah doth put in my mouth &ndash; it do I not take heed to speak?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:13]</strong> And Balak saith unto him, `Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, whence thou dost see it, only its extremity thou dost see, and all of it thou dost not see, and pierce it for me thence;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:14]</strong> and he taketh him `to&rsquo; the field of Zophim, unto the top of Pisgah, and buildeth seven altars, and offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar.</p>
<p><strong>[23:15]</strong> And he saith unto Balak, <code>Station thyself here by thy burnt-offering, and I -- I meet </code>Him&rsquo; there;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:16]</strong> and Jehovah cometh unto Balaam, and setteth a word in his mouth, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:17]</strong> And he cometh unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him, and Balak saith to him: `What hath Jehovah spoken?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:18]</strong> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Rise, Balak, and hear; Give ear unto me, son of Zippor!</p>
<p><strong>[23:19]</strong> God <code>is' not a man -- and lieth, And a son of man -- and repenteth! Hath He said -- and doth He not do </code>it&rsquo;? And spoken &ndash; and doth He not confirm it?</p>
<p><strong>[23:20]</strong> Lo, to bless I have received: Yea, He blesseth, and I `can&rsquo;not reverse it.</p>
<p><strong>[23:21]</strong> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Nor hath He seen perverseness in Israel; Jehovah his God <code>is' with him, And a shout of a king </code>is&rsquo; in him.</p>
<p><strong>[23:22]</strong> God is bringing them out from Egypt, As the swiftness of a Reem is to him;</p>
<p><strong>[23:23]</strong> For no enchantment `is&rsquo; against Jacob, Nor divination against Israel, At the time it is said of Jacob and Israel, What hath God wrought!</p>
<p><strong>[23:24]</strong> Lo, the people as a lioness riseth, And as a lion he lifteth himself up, He lieth not down till he eateth prey, And blood of pierced ones doth drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:25]</strong> And Balak saith unto Balaam, `Neither pierce it at all, nor bless it at all;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:26]</strong> and Balaam answereth and saith unto Balak, `Have I not spoken unto thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh &ndash; it I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:27]</strong> And Balak saith unto Balaam, `Come, I pray thee, I take thee unto another place; it may be it is right in the eyes of God &ndash; to pierce it for me from thence.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:28]</strong> And Balak taketh Balaam to the top of Peor, which is looking on the front of the wilderness,</p>
<p><strong>[23:29]</strong> and Balaam saith unto Balak, <code>Build for me in this </code>place&rsquo; seven altars, and make ready for me in this `place&rsquo; seven bullocks and seven rams;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[23:30]</strong> and Balak doth as Balaam said, and he offereth a bullock and a ram on an altar.</p>
<p><strong>[24:1]</strong> And Balaam seeth that `it is&rsquo; good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he hath not gone as time by time to meet enchantments, and he setteth towards the wilderness his face;</p>
<p><strong>[24:2]</strong> and Balaam lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Israel tabernacling, by its tribes, and the Spirit of God is upon him,</p>
<p><strong>[24:3]</strong> and he taketh up his simile, and saith: `An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor &ndash; And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[24:4]</strong> An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God &ndash; Who a vision of the Almighty seeth, Falling &ndash; and eyes uncovered:</p>
<p><strong>[24:5]</strong> How good have been thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[24:6]</strong> As valleys they have been stretched out, As gardens by a river; As aloes Jehovah hath planted, As cedars by waters;</p>
<p><strong>[24:7]</strong> He maketh water flow from his buckets, And his seed <code>is' in many waters; And higher than Agag </code>is&rsquo; his king, And exalted is his kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>[24:8]</strong> God is bringing him out of Egypt; As the swiftness of a Reem is to him, He eateth up nations his adversaries, And their bones he breaketh, And `with&rsquo; his arrows he smiteth,</p>
<p><strong>[24:9]</strong> He hath bent, he hath lain down as a lion, And as a lioness: who doth raise him up? He who is blessing thee <code>is' blessed, And he who is cursing thee </code>is&rsquo; cursed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:10]</strong> And the anger of Balak burneth against Balaam, and he striketh his hands; and Balak saith unto Balaam, `To pierce mine enemies I called thee, and lo, thou hast certainly blessed &ndash; these three times;</p>
<p><strong>[24:11]</strong> and now, flee for thyself unto thy place; I have said, I do greatly honour thee, and lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:12]</strong> And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Did I not also unto thy messengers whom thou hast sent unto me, speak, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[24:13]</strong> If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah, to do good or evil of mine own heart &ndash; that which Jehovah speaketh &ndash; it I speak?</p>
<p><strong>[24:14]</strong> and, now, lo, I am going to my people; come, I counsel thee `concerning&rsquo; that which this people doth to thy people, in the latter end of the days.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:15]</strong> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: <code>An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor -- And an affirmation of the man whose eyes </code>are&rsquo; shut &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[24:16]</strong> An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God &ndash; And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he seeth, Falling &ndash; and eyes uncovered:</p>
<p><strong>[24:17]</strong> I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not near; A star hath proceeded from Jacob, And a sceptre hath risen from Israel, And hath smitten corners of Moab, And hath destroyed all sons of Sheth.</p>
<p><strong>[24:18]</strong> And Edom hath been a possession, And Seir hath been a possession, `for&rsquo; its enemies, And Israel is doing valiantly;</p>
<p><strong>[24:19]</strong> And `one&rsquo; doth rule out of Jacob, And hath destroyed a remnant from Ar.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:20]</strong> And he seeth Amalek, and taketh up his simile, and saith: <code>A beginning of the Goyim </code>is&rsquo; Amalek; And his latter end &ndash; for ever he perisheth.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:21]</strong> And he seeth the Kenite, and taketh up his simile, and saith: <code>Enduring </code>is&rsquo; thy dwelling, And setting in a rock thy nest,</p>
<p><strong>[24:22]</strong> But the Kenite is for a burning; Till when doth Asshur keep thee captive?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:23]</strong> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Alas! who doth live when God doth this?</p>
<p><strong>[24:24]</strong> And &ndash; ships `are&rsquo; from the side of Chittim, And they have humbled Asshur, And they have humbled Eber, And it also for ever is perishing.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[24:25]</strong> And Balaam riseth, and goeth, and turneth back to his place, and Balak also hath gone on his way.</p>
<p><strong>[25:1]</strong> And Israel dwelleth in Shittim, and the people begin to go a-whoring unto daughters of Moab,</p>
<p><strong>[25:2]</strong> and they call for the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people eat, and bow themselves to their gods,</p>
<p><strong>[25:3]</strong> and Israel is joined to Baal-Peor, and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[25:4]</strong> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them before Jehovah &ndash; over-against the sun; and the fierceness of the anger of Jehovah doth turn back from Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[25:5]</strong> And Moses saith unto the judges of Israel, `Slay ye each his men who are joined to Baal-Peor.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[25:6]</strong> And lo, a man of the sons of Israel hath come, and bringeth in unto his brethren the Midianitess, before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the company of the sons of Israel, who are weeping at the opening of the tent of meeting;</p>
<p><strong>[25:7]</strong> and Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, the priest, seeth, and riseth from the midst of the company, and taketh a javelin in his hand,</p>
<p><strong>[25:8]</strong> and goeth in after the man of Israel unto the hollow place, and pierceth them both, the man of Israel and the woman &ndash; unto her belly, and the plague is restrained from the sons of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[25:9]</strong> and the dead by the plague are four and twenty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>[25:10]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[25:11]</strong> `Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, hath turned back My fury from the sons of Israel, by his being zealous with My zeal in their midst, and I have not consumed the sons of Israel in My zeal.</p>
<p><strong>[25:12]</strong> `Therefore say, Lo, I am giving to him My covenant of peace,</p>
<p><strong>[25:13]</strong> and it hath been to him and to his seed after him a covenant of a priesthood age-during, because that he hath been zealous for his God, and doth make atonement for the sons of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[25:14]</strong> And the name of the man of Israel who is smitten, who hath been smitten with the Midianitess, `is&rsquo; Zimri son of Salu, prince of the house of a father of the Simeonite;</p>
<p><strong>[25:15]</strong> and the name of the woman who is smitten, the Midianitess, <code>is' Cozbi daughter of Zur, head of a people -- of the house of a father in Midian </code>is&rsquo; he.</p>
<p><strong>[25:16]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[25:17]</strong> `Distress the Midianites, and ye have smitten them,</p>
<p><strong>[25:18]</strong> for they are adversaries to you with their frauds, `with&rsquo; which they have acted fraudulently to you, concerning the matter of Peor, and concerning the matter of Cozbi, daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who is smitten in the day of the plague for the matter of Peor.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[26:1]</strong> And it cometh to pass, after the plague, that Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[26:2]</strong> `Take up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel, from a son of twenty years and upward, by the house of their fathers, every one going out to the host in Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[26:3]</strong> And Moses speaketh &ndash; Eleazar the priest also &ndash; with them, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, `near&rsquo; Jericho, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[26:4]</strong> `From a son of twenty years and upward,&rsquo; as Jehovah hath commanded Moses and the sons of Israel who are coming out from the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>[30:2]</strong> `When a man voweth a vow to Jehovah, or hath sworn an oath to bind a bond on his soul, he doth not pollute his word; according to all that is going out from his mouth he doth.</p>
<p><strong>[30:3]</strong> `And when a woman voweth a vow to Jehovah, and hath bound a bond in the house of her father in her youth,</p>
<p><strong>[30:4]</strong> and her father hath heard her vow, and her bond which she hath bound on her soul, and her father hath kept silent at her, then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she hath bound on her soul is established.</p>
<p><strong>[30:5]</strong> `And if her father hath disallowed her in the day of his hearing, none of her vows and her bonds which she hath bound on her soul is established, and Jehovah is propitious to her, for her father hath disallowed her.</p>

<p><strong>[30:8]</strong> <code>And if in the day of her husband's hearing he disalloweth her, then he hath broken her vow which </code>is&rsquo; on her, and the wrongful utterance of her lips which she hath bound on her soul, and Jehovah is propitious to her.</p>
<p><strong>[30:9]</strong> `As to the vow of a widow or cast-out woman, all that she hath bound on her soul is established on her.</p>
<p><strong>[30:10]</strong> <code>And if </code>in&rsquo; the house of her husband she hath vowed, or hath bound a bond on her soul with an oath,</p>
<p><strong>[30:11]</strong> and her husband hath heard, and hath kept silent at her &ndash; he hath not disallowed her &ndash; then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she hath bound on her soul is established.</p>
<p><strong>[30:12]</strong> `And if her husband doth certainly break them in the day of his hearing, none of the outgoing of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, is established &ndash; her husband hath broken them &ndash; and Jehovah is propitious to her.</p>

<p><strong>[30:16]</strong> These <code>are' the statutes which Jehovah hath commanded Moses between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her youth, </code>in&rsquo; the house of her father.</p>

<p><strong>[31:2]</strong> `Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the Midianites &ndash; afterwards thou art gathered unto thy people.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:3]</strong> And Moses speaketh unto the people, saying, `Be ye armed some of you for the host, and they are against Midian, to put the vengeance of Jehovah on Midian;</p>
<p><strong>[31:4]</strong> a thousand for a tribe &ndash; a thousand for a tribe, to all the tribes of Israel &ndash; ye do send to the host.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:5]</strong> And there are given out of the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed ones of the host;</p>
<p><strong>[31:6]</strong> and Moses sendeth them, a thousand for a tribe, to the host, them and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, to the host; and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the shouting, in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>[31:7]</strong> And they war against Midian, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses, and slay every male;</p>
<p><strong>[31:8]</strong> and the kings of Midian they have slain, besides their pierced ones, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam son of Beor, they have slain with the sword.</p>
<p><strong>[31:9]</strong> And the sons of Israel take captive the women of Midian, and their infants; and all their cattle, and all their substance, and all their wealth they have plundered;</p>
<p><strong>[31:10]</strong> and all their cities, with their habitations, and all their towers, they have burnt with fire.</p>
<p><strong>[31:11]</strong> And they take all the spoil, and all the prey, among man and among beast;</p>
<p><strong>[31:12]</strong> and they bring in, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the company of the sons of Israel, the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto the camp, unto the plains of Moab, which <code>are' by Jordan, </code>near&rsquo; Jericho.</p>
<p><strong>[31:13]</strong> And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the company, go out to meet them, unto the outside of the camp,</p>
<p><strong>[31:14]</strong> and Moses is wroth against the inspectors of the force, chiefs of the thousands, and chiefs of the hundreds, who are coming in from the host of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>[31:15]</strong> And Moses saith unto them, `Have ye kept alive every female?</p>
<p><strong>[31:16]</strong> lo, they &ndash; they have been to the sons of Israel, through the word of Balaam, to cause a trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and the plague is in the company of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[31:17]</strong> `And now, slay ye every male among the infants, yea, every woman known of man by the lying of a male ye have slain;</p>
<p><strong>[31:18]</strong> and all the infants among the women, who have not known the lying of a male, ye have kept alive for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>[31:19]</strong> `And ye, encamp ye at the outside of the camp seven days &ndash; any who hath slain a person, and any who hath come against a pierced one, ye cleanse yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day &ndash; ye and your captives;</p>

<p><strong>[31:21]</strong> And Eleazar the priest saith unto the men of the host who go in to battle, <code>This </code>is&rsquo; the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:</p>
<p><strong>[31:22]</strong> only, the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</p>
<p><strong>[31:23]</strong> every thing which may go into fire, ye cause to pass over through fire, and it hath been clean; only, with the water of separation it is cleansed, and all that may not go into fire, ye cause to pass over through water;</p>
<p><strong>[31:24]</strong> and ye have washed your garments on the seventh day, and have been clean, and afterwards ye come in unto the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:25]</strong> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[31:26]</strong> `Take up the sum of the prey of the captives, among man and among beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the company;</p>
<p><strong>[31:27]</strong> and thou hast halved the prey between those handling the battle who go out to the host and all the company;</p>
<p><strong>[31:28]</strong> and thou hast raised a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war, who go out to the host, one body out of five hundred, of man, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock;</p>
<p><strong>[31:29]</strong> from their half ye do take, and thou hast given to Eleazar the priest &ndash; the heave-offering of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[31:30]</strong> `And from the sons of Israel&rsquo;s half thou dost take one possession out of fifty, of man, of the herd, of the asses, and of the flock, of all the cattle, and thou hast given them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:31]</strong> And Moses doth &ndash; Eleazar the priest also &ndash; as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[31:32]</strong> And the prey, the residue of the spoil which the people of the host have spoiled, is of the flock six hundred thousand, and seventy thousand, and five thousand;</p>
<p><strong>[31:33]</strong> and of the herd two and seventy thousand;</p>
<p><strong>[31:34]</strong> and of asses one and sixty thousand;</p>
<p><strong>[31:35]</strong> and of human beings &ndash; of the women who have not known the lying of a male &ndash; all the persons `are&rsquo; two and thirty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>[31:36]</strong> And the half &ndash; the portion of those who go out into the host &ndash; the number of the flock is three hundred thousand, and thirty thousand, and seven thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>[31:37]</strong> And the tribute to Jehovah of the sheep is six hundred five and seventy;</p>
<p><strong>[31:38]</strong> and the herd <code>is' six and thirty thousand, and their tribute to Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; two and seventy;</p>
<p><strong>[31:39]</strong> and the asses <code>are' thirty thousand and five hundred, and their tribute to Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; one and sixty;</p>
<p><strong>[31:40]</strong> and the human beings <code>are' sixteen thousand, and their tribute to Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; two and thirty persons.</p>
<p><strong>[31:41]</strong> And Moses giveth the tribute &ndash; Jehovah&rsquo;s heave-offering &ndash; to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[31:42]</strong> And of the sons of Israel&rsquo;s half, which Moses halved from the men who war &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[31:43]</strong> and the company&rsquo;s half is, of the flock three hundred thousand, and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred;</p>
<p><strong>[31:44]</strong> and of the herd six and thirty thousand;</p>
<p><strong>[31:45]</strong> and of asses thirty thousand and five hundred;</p>
<p><strong>[31:46]</strong> and of human beings sixteen thousand &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[31:47]</strong> Moses taketh from the sons of Israel&rsquo;s half the one possession from the fifty, of man and of beast, and giveth them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>
<p><strong>[31:48]</strong> And the inspectors whom the thousands of the host hath, (heads of the thousands and heads of the hundreds), draw near unto Moses,</p>
<p><strong>[31:49]</strong> and they say unto Moses, <code>Thy servants have taken up the sum of the men of war who </code>are&rsquo; with us, and not a man of us hath been missed;</p>
<p><strong>[31:50]</strong> and we bring near Jehovah&rsquo;s offering, each that which he hath found, vessels of gold &ndash; chain, and bracelet, seal-ring, `ear&rsquo;-ring, and bead &ndash; to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[31:51]</strong> And Moses receiveth &ndash; Eleazar the priest also &ndash; the gold from them, every made vessel,</p>
<p><strong>[31:52]</strong> and all the gold of the heave-offering which they have lifted up to Jehovah is sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from heads of the thousands, and from heads of the hundreds;</p>
<p><strong>[31:53]</strong> (the men of the host have spoiled each for himself);</p>
<p><strong>[31:54]</strong> and Moses taketh &ndash; Eleazar the priest also &ndash; the gold from the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds, and they bring it in unto the tent of meeting &ndash; a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[32:1]</strong> And much cattle hath been to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad, very many; and they see the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, and lo, the place <code>is' a place </code>for&rsquo; cattle;</p>
<p><strong>[32:2]</strong> and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Reuben, come in and speak unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the company, saying:</p>
<p><strong>[32:3]</strong> `Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[32:4]</strong> the land which Jehovah hath smitten before the company of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:5]</strong> And they say, `If we have found grace in thine eyes, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession; cause us not to pass over the Jordan.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:6]</strong> And Moses saith to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, `Do your brethren go in to the battle, and ye &ndash; do ye sit here?</p>
<p><strong>[32:7]</strong> and why discourage ye the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over unto the land which Jehovah hath given to them?</p>
<p><strong>[32:8]</strong> `Thus did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land;</p>
<p><strong>[32:9]</strong> and they go up unto the valley of Eshcol, and see the land, and discourage the heart of the sons of Israel so as not to go in unto the land which Jehovah hath given to them;</p>
<p><strong>[32:10]</strong> and the anger of Jehovah burneth in that day, and He sweareth, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[32:11]</strong> They do not see &ndash; the men who are coming up out of Egypt from a son of twenty years and upward &ndash; the ground which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, for they have not been fully after Me;</p>
<p><strong>[32:12]</strong> save Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they have been fully after Jehovah;</p>
<p><strong>[32:13]</strong> and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He causeth them to wander in the wilderness forty years, until the consumption of all the generation which is doing the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[32:14]</strong> `And lo, ye have risen in the stead of your fathers, an increase of men &ndash; sinners, to add yet to the fury of the anger of Jehovah toward Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[32:15]</strong> when ye turn back from after Him, then He hath added yet to leave him in the wilderness, and ye have done corruptly to all this people.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:16]</strong> And they come nigh unto him, and say, `Folds for the flock we build for our cattle here, and cities for our infants;</p>
<p><strong>[32:17]</strong> and we &ndash; we are armed hasting before the sons of Israel till that we have brought them in unto their place; and our infants have dwelt in the cities of defence because of the inhabitants of the land;</p>
<p><strong>[32:18]</strong> we do not turn back unto our houses till the sons of Israel have inherited each his inheritance,</p>
<p><strong>[32:19]</strong> for we do not inherit with them beyond the Jordan and yonder, for our inheritance hath come unto us beyond the Jordan at the `sun&rsquo;-rising.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:20]</strong> And Moses saith unto them, `If ye do this thing: if ye are armed before Jehovah for battle,</p>
<p><strong>[32:21]</strong> and every armed one of you hath passed over the Jordan before Jehovah, till his dispossessing His enemies from before Him,</p>
<p><strong>[32:22]</strong> and the land hath been subdued before Jehovah &ndash; then afterwards ye do turn back, and have been acquitted by Jehovah, and by Israel; and this land hath been to you for a possession before Jehovah.</p>
<p><strong>[32:23]</strong> `And if ye do not so, lo, ye have sinned against Jehovah, and know ye your sin, that it doth find you;</p>
<p><strong>[32:24]</strong> build for yourselves cities for your infants, and folds for your flock, and that which is going out from your mouth do ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:25]</strong> And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben speak unto Moses, saying, `Thy servants do as my lord is commanding;</p>
<p><strong>[32:26]</strong> our infants, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts, are there in cities of Gilead,</p>
<p><strong>[32:27]</strong> and thy servants pass over, every armed one of the host, before Jehovah, to battle, as my lord is saying.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:28]</strong> And Moses commandeth concerning them Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[32:29]</strong> and Moses saith unto them, `If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben pass over with you the Jordan, every one armed for battle, before Jehovah, and the land hath been subdued before you, then ye have given to them the land of Gilead for a possession;</p>
<p><strong>[32:30]</strong> and if they do not pass over armed with you, then they have possessions in your midst in the land of Canaan.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:31]</strong> And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answer, saying, `That which Jehovah hath spoken unto thy servants &ndash; so we do;</p>
<p><strong>[32:32]</strong> we &ndash; we pass over armed before Jehovah <code>to' the land of Canaan, and with us </code>is&rsquo; the possession of our inheritance beyond the Jordan.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:33]</strong> And Moses giveth to them, to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorite, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land by its cities, in the borders, the cities of the land round about.</p>
<p><strong>[32:34]</strong> And the sons of Gad build Dihon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>
<p><strong>[32:35]</strong> and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</p>
<p><strong>[32:36]</strong> and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran, cities of defence, and sheepfolds.</p>
<p><strong>[32:37]</strong> And the sons of Reuben have build Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</p>
<p><strong>[32:38]</strong> and Nebo, and Baal-Meon (changed in name), and Shibmah, and they call by `these&rsquo; names the names of the cities which they have built.</p>
<p><strong>[32:39]</strong> And sons of Machir son of Manasseh go to Gilead, and capture it, and dispossess the Amorite, who `is&rsquo; in it;</p>
<p><strong>[32:40]</strong> and Moses giveth Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he dwelleth in it.</p>
<p><strong>[32:41]</strong> And Jair son of Manasseh hath gone and captureth their towns, and calleth them `Towns of Jair;&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[32:42]</strong> and Nobah hath gone and captureth Kenath, and its villages, and calleth it Nobah, by his own name.</p>
<p><strong>[33:1]</strong> These `are&rsquo; journeys of the sons of Israel who have come out of the land of Egypt, by their hosts, by the hand of Moses and Aaron;</p>

<p><strong>[33:3]</strong> And they journey from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow of the passover have the sons of Israel gone out with a high hand, before the eyes of all the Egyptians &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[33:4]</strong> and the Egyptians are burying those whom Jehovah hath smitten among them, every first-born, and on their gods hath Jehovah done judgments &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>[33:5]</strong> and the sons of Israel journey from Rameses, and encamp in Succoth.</p>

<p><strong>[35:25]</strong> `And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the hand of the redeemer of blood, and the company have caused him to turn back unto the city of his refuge, whither he hath fled, and he hath dwelt in it till the death of the chief priest, who hath been anointed with the holy oil.</p>
<p><strong>[35:26]</strong> <code>And if the man-slayer at all go out </code>from&rsquo; the border of the city of his refuge whither he fleeth,</p>
<p><strong>[35:27]</strong> and the redeemer of blood hath found him at the outside of the border of the city of his refuge, and the redeemer of blood hath slain the man-slayer, blood is not for him;</p>
<p><strong>[35:28]</strong> for in the city of his refuge he doth dwell till the death of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest doth the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession.</p>
<p><strong>[35:29]</strong> `And these things have been to you for a statute of judgment to your generations, in all your dwellings:</p>
<p><strong>[35:30]</strong> whoso smiteth a person, by the mouth of witnesses doth `one&rsquo; slay the murderer; and one witness doth not testify against a person &ndash; to die.</p>
<p><strong>[35:31]</strong> <code>And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who </code>is&rsquo; condemned &ndash; to die, for he is certainly put to death;</p>
<p><strong>[35:32]</strong> and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of his refuge, to turn back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</p>
<p><strong>[35:33]</strong> <code>And ye profane not the land which ye </code>are&rsquo; in, for blood profaneth the land; as to the land, it is not pardoned for blood which is shed in it except by the blood of him who sheddeth it;</p>
<p><strong>[35:34]</strong> and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling, in the midst of which I do tabernacle, for I Jehovah do tabernacle in the midst of the sons of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[36:1]</strong> And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, come near, and speak before Moses, and before the princes, heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[36:2]</strong> and say, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my lord hath been commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.</p>
<p><strong>[36:3]</strong> <code>And -- they have been to one of the sons of the </code>other&rsquo; tribes of the sons of Israel for wives, and their inheritance hath been withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers, and hath been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the lot of our inheritance it is withdrawn,</p>
<p><strong>[36:4]</strong> and if it is the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then hath their inheritance been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers is their inheritance withdrawn.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[36:5]</strong> And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, by the command of Jehovah, saying, `Rightly are the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaking;</p>
<p><strong>[36:6]</strong> this `is&rsquo; the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To those good in their eyes let them be for wives; only, to a family of the tribe of their fathers let them be for wives;</p>
<p><strong>[36:7]</strong> and the inheritance of the sons of Israel doth not turn round from tribe unto tribe; for each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers, do the sons of Israel cleave.</p>
<p><strong>[36:8]</strong> `And every daughter possessing an inheritance, of the tribes of the sons of Israel, is to one of the family of the tribe of her father for a wife, so that the sons of Israel possess each the inheritance of his fathers,</p>
<p><strong>[36:9]</strong> and the inheritance doth not turn round from `one&rsquo; tribe to another tribe; for each to his inheritance do they cleave, the tribes of the sons of Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[36:10]</strong> As Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the daughters of Zelophehad done,</p>
<p><strong>[36:11]</strong> and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, are to the sons of their fathers&rsquo; brethren for wives;</p>
<p><strong>[36:12]</strong> `to men&rsquo; of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they have been for wives, and their inheritance is with the tribe of the family of their father.</p>
<p><strong>[36:13]</strong> These <code>are' the commands and the judgments which Jehovah hath commanded, by the hand of Moses, concerning the sons of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, </code>near&rsquo; Jericho.</p>
