    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> And it cometh to pass, in the days of the judging of the judges, that there is a famine in the land, and there goeth a man from Beth-Lehem-Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> And the name of the man `is&rsquo; Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Beth-Lehem-Judah; and they come into the fields of Moab, and are there.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth, and she is left, she and her two sons;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> and they take to them wives, Moabitesses: the name of the one `is&rsquo; Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwell there about ten years.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> And they die also, both of them &ndash; Mahlon and Chilion &ndash; and the woman is left of her two children and of her husband.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> And she riseth, she and her daughters-in-law, and turneth back from the fields of Moab, for she hath heard in the fields of Moab that God hath looked after His people, &ndash; to give to them bread.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> And she goeth out from the place where she hath been, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they go in the way to turn back unto the land of Judah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> And Naomi saith to her two daughters-in-law, `Go, turn back, each to the house of her mother; Jehovah doth with you kindness as ye have done with the dead, and with me;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> Jehovah doth grant to you, and find ye rest each in the house of her husband;&rsquo; and she kisseth them, and they lift up their voice and weep.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> And they say to her, `Surely with thee we go back to thy people.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> And Naomi saith, `Turn back, my daughters; why do ye go with me? are there yet to me sons in my bowels that they have been to you for husbands?</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too aged to be to a husband; though I had said, There is for me hope, also, I have been to-night to a husband, and also I have borne sons:</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye shut yourselves up, not to be to a husband? nay, my daughters, for more bitter to me than to you, for the hand of Jehovah hath gone out against me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> And they lift up their voice, and weep again, and Orpah kisseth her mother-in-law, and Ruth hath cleaved to her.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> And she saith, `Lo, thy sister-in-law hath turned back unto her people, and unto her god, turn thou back after thy sister-in-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> And Ruth saith, <code>Urge me not to leave thee -- to turn back from after thee; for whither thou goest I go, and where thou lodgest I lodge; thy people </code>is&rsquo; my people, and thy God my God.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> Where thou diest I die, and there I am buried; thus doth Jehovah to me, and thus doth He add &ndash; for death itself doth part between me and thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> And she seeth that she is strengthening herself to go with her, and she ceaseth to speak unto her;</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem; and it cometh to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem, that all the city is moved at them, and they say, `Is this Naomi?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> And she saith unto them, `Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly to me,</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> I went out full, and empty hath Jehovah brought me back, why do ye call me Naomi, and Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath done evil to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> And Naomi turneth back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who hath turned back from the fields of Moab, and they have come in to Beth-Lehem at the commencement of barley-harvest.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> And Naomi hath an acquaintance of her husband&rsquo;s, a man mighty in wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name `is&rsquo; Boaz.</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> And Ruth the Moabitess saith unto Naomi, <code>Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and I gather among the ears of corn after him in whose eyes I find grace;' and she saith to her, </code>Go, my daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> And she goeth and cometh and gathereth in a field after the reapers, and her chance happeneth &ndash; the portion of the field is Boaz&rsquo;s who `is&rsquo; of the family of Elimelech.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> And lo, Boaz hath come from Beth-Lehem, and saith to the reapers, <code>Jehovah </code>is&rsquo; with you;&rsquo; and they say to him, `Jehovah doth bless thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> And Boaz saith to his young man who is set over the reapers, <code>Whose </code>is&rsquo; this young person?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> And the young man who is set over the reapers answereth and saith, <code>A young woman -- Moabitess -- she </code>is&rsquo;, who came back with Naomi from the fields of Moab,</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> and she saith, Let me glean, I pray thee &ndash; and I have gathered among the sheaves after the reapers; and she cometh and remaineth since the morning and till now; she sat in the house a little.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> And Boaz saith unto Ruth, `Hast thou not heard, my daughter? go not to glean in another field, and also, pass not over from this, and thus thou dost cleave to my young women:</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> thine eyes `are&rsquo; on the field which they reap, and thou hast gone after them; have not I charged the young men not to touch thee? when thou art athirst then thou hast gone unto the vessels, and hast drunk from that which the young men draw.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> And she falleth on her face, and boweth herself to the earth, and saith unto him, `Wherefore have I found grace in thine eyes, to discern me, and I a stranger?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> And Boaz answereth and saith to her, `It hath thoroughly been declared to me all that thou hast done with thy mother-in-law, after the death of thy husband, and thou dost leave thy father, and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and dost come in unto a people which thou hast not known heretofore.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> Jehovah doth recompense thy work, and thy reward is complete from Jehovah, God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to take refuge.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> And she saith, `Let me find grace in thine eyes, my lord, because thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken unto the heart of thy maid-servant, and I &ndash; I am not as one of thy maid-servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> And Boaz saith to her, `At meal-time come nigh hither, and thou hast eaten of the bread, and dipped thy morsel in the vinegar.&rsquo; And she sitteth at the side of the reapers, and he reacheth to her roasted corn, and she eateth, and is satisfied, and leaveth.</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> And she riseth to glean, and Boaz chargeth his young men, saying, `Even between the sheaves she doth glean, and ye do not cause her to blush;</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> and also ye do surely cast to her of the handfuls &ndash; and have left, and she hath gleaned, and ye do not push against her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> And she gleaneth in the field till the evening, and beateth out that which she hath gleaned, and it is about an ephah of barley;</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> and she taketh `it&rsquo; up, and goeth into the city, and her mother-in-law seeth that which she hath gleaned, and she bringeth out and giveth to her that which she left from her satiety.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> And her mother-in-law saith to her, <code>Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? may he who is discerning thee be blessed.' And she declareth to her mother-in-law with whom she hath wrought, and saith, </code>The name of the man with whom I have wrought to-day `is&rsquo; Boaz.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> And Naomi saith to her daughter-in-law, <code>Blessed </code>is&rsquo; he of Jehovah who hath not forsaken His kindness with the living and with the dead;&rsquo; and Naomi saith to her, <code>The man is a relation of ours; he </code>is&rsquo; of our redeemers.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> And Ruth the Moabitess saith, `Also he surely said unto me, Near the young people whom I have thou dost cleave till they have completed the whole of the harvest which I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> And Naomi saith unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, `Good, my daughter, that thou goest out with his young women, and they come not against thee in another field.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:23]</strong> And she cleaveth to the young women of Boaz to glean, till the completion of the barley-harvest, and of the wheat-harvest, and she dwelleth with her mother-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> And Naomi her mother-in-law saith to her, `My daughter, do not I seek for thee rest, that it may be well with thee?</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> and now, is not Boaz of our acquaintance, with whose young women thou hast been? lo, he is winnowing the threshing-floor of barley to-night,</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> and thou hast bathed, and anointed thyself, and put thy garments upon thee, and gone down to the threshing-floor; let not thyself be known to the man till he complete to eat and to drink;</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> and it cometh to pass when he lieth down, that thou hast known the place where he lieth down, and hast gone in, and uncovered his feet, and lain down, &ndash; and he doth declare to thee that which thou dost do.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> And she saith unto her, `All that thou sayest &ndash; I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> And she goeth down `to&rsquo; the threshing-floor, and doth according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> And Boaz eateth and drinketh, and his heart is glad; and he goeth in to lie down at the end of the heap; and she cometh in gently, and uncovereth his feet, and lieth down.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> And it cometh to pass, at the middle of the night, that the man trembleth, and turneth himself, and lo, a woman is lying at his feet.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> And he saith, <code>Who </code>art&rsquo; thou?&rsquo; and she saith, <code>I </code>am&rsquo; Ruth thy handmaid, and thou hast spread thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou `art&rsquo; a redeemer.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> And he saith, <code>Blessed </code>art&rsquo; thou of Jehovah, my daughter; thou hast dealt more kindly at the latter end than at the beginning &ndash; not to go after the young men, either poor or rich.</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> And now, my daughter, fear not, all that thou sayest I do to thee, for all the gate of my people doth know that thou `art&rsquo; a virtuous woman.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> And now, surely, true, that I `am&rsquo; a redeemer, but also there is a redeemer nearer than I.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> Lodge to night, and it hath been in the morning, if he doth redeem thee, well: he redeemeth; and if he delight not to redeem thee, then I have redeemed thee &ndash; I; Jehovah liveth! lie down till the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> And she lieth down at his feet till the morning, and riseth before one doth discern another; and he saith, `Let it not be known that the woman hath come into the floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> And he saith, <code>Give the covering which </code>is&rsquo; on thee, and keep hold on it;&rsquo; and she keepeth hold on it, and he measureth six <code>measures' of barley, and layeth </code>it&rsquo; on her; and he goeth into the city.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> And she cometh in unto her mother-in-law, and she saith, <code>Who </code>art&rsquo; thou, my daughter?&rsquo; and she declareth to her all that the man hath done to her.</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> And she saith, <code>These six </code>measures&rsquo; of barley he hath given to me, for he said, Thou dost not go in empty unto thy mother-in-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[3:18]</strong> And she saith, `Sit still, my daughter, till thou dost know how the matter falleth, for the man doth not rest except he hath completed the matter to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> And Boaz hath gone up to the gate, and sitteth there, and lo, the redeemer is passing by of whom Boaz had spoken, and he saith, `Turn aside, sit down here, such a one, such a one;&rsquo; and he turneth aside and sitteth down.</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city, and saith, `Sit down here;&rsquo; and they sit down.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> And he saith to the redeemer, <code>A portion of the field which </code>is&rsquo; to our brother, to Elimelech, hath Naomi sold, who hath come back from the fields of Moab;</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> and I said, I uncover thine ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people; if thou dost redeem &ndash; redeem, and if none doth redeem &ndash; declare to me, and I know, for there is none save thee to redeem, and I after thee.&rsquo; And he saith, I redeem `it&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> And Boaz saith, <code>In the day of thy buying the field from the hand of Naomi, then from Ruth the Moabitess, wife of the dead, thou hast bought </code>it&rsquo;, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> And the redeemer saith, <code>I am not able to redeem </code>it&rsquo; for myself, lest I destroy mine inheritance; redeem for thyself &ndash; thou &ndash; my right of redemption, for I am not able to redeem.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> And this <code>is' formerly in Israel for redemption and for changing, to establish anything: a man hath drawn off his sandal, and given </code>it&rsquo; to his neighbour, and this `is&rsquo; the testimony in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> And the redeemer saith to Boaz, <code>Buy </code>it&rsquo; for thyself,&rsquo; and draweth off his sandal.</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> And Boaz saith to the elders, and <code>to' all the people, </code>Witnesses <code>are' ye to-day that I have bought all that </code>is&rsquo; to Elimelech, and all that `is&rsquo; to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi;</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> and also Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, I have bought to myself for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance; and the name of the dead is not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; witnesses ye `are&rsquo; to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> And all the people who <code>are' in the gate say -- also the elders -- </code>Witnesses! Jehovah make the woman who is coming in unto thy house as Rachel and as Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and do thou virtuously in Ephrathah, and proclaim the Name in Beth-Lehem;</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> and let thy house be as the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare to Judah), of the seed which Jehovah doth give to thee of this young woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> And Boaz taketh Ruth, and she becometh his wife, and he goeth in unto her, and Jehovah giveth to her conception, and she beareth a son.</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> And the women say unto Naomi, <code>Blessed </code>is&rsquo; Jehovah who hath not let a redeemer cease to thee to-day, and his name is proclaimed in Israel,</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> and he hath been to thee for a restorer of life, and for a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law who hath loved thee &ndash; who is better to thee than seven sons &ndash; hath borne him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> And Naomi taketh the lad, and layeth him in her bosom, and is to him for a nurse;</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> and the neighbouring women give to him a name, saying, <code>There hath been a son born to Naomi,' and they call his name Obed; he </code>is&rsquo; father of Jesse, father of David.</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> And these are genealogies of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminidab,</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> and Amminidab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>
