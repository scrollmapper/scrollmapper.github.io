    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For God didn&rsquo;t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Therefore don&rsquo;t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Gospel according to the power of God,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> For this cause I suffer also these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn&rsquo;t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel,</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God&rsquo;s word isn&rsquo;t chained.</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones&rsquo; sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> This saying is faithful: For if we died with him, We will also live with him.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> If we endure, We will also reign with him. If we deny him, He also will deny us.</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> If we are faithless, He remains faithful. He can&rsquo;t deny himself.</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don&rsquo;t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn&rsquo;t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> However God&rsquo;s firm foundation stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are his,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;} depart from unrighteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master&rsquo;s use, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p><strong>[2:23]</strong> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</p>
<p><strong>[2:24]</strong> The Lord&rsquo;s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</p>
<p><strong>[2:25]</strong> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p><strong>[2:26]</strong> and they may recover themselves out of the devil&rsquo;s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> Be diligent to come to me soon,</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
