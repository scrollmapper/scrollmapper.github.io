<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> for the truth&rsquo;s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don&rsquo;t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Watch yourselves, that we don&rsquo;t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> Whoever transgresses and doesn&rsquo;t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn&rsquo;t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> If anyone comes to you, and doesn&rsquo;t bring this teaching, don&rsquo;t receive him into your house, and don&rsquo;t welcome him,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Having many things to write to you, I don&rsquo;t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
