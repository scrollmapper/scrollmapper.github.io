    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> in hope of eternal life, which God, who can&rsquo;t lie, promised before eternal times;</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For the overseer must be blameless, as God&rsquo;s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober-minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, &ldquo;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God&rsquo;s word may not be blasphemed.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober-minded;</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> and soundness of speech that can&rsquo;t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
