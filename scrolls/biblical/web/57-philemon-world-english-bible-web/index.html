<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> yet for love&rsquo;s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,{Onesimus means &ldquo;useful.&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
