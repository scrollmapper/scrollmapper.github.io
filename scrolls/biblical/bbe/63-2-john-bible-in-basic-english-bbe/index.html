<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God&rsquo;s selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true;</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> The children of your noble sister, who is of God&rsquo;s selection, send you their love.</p>
