<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God&rsquo;s army, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.</p>
