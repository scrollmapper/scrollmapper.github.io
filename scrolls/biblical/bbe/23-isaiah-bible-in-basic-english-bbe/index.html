<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw about Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> Give ear, O heavens, and you, O earth, to the word which the Lord has said: I have taken care of my children till they became men, but their hearts have been turned away from me.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Even the ox has knowledge of its owner, and the ass of the place where its master puts its food: but Israel has no knowledge, my people give no thought to me.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> O nation full of sin, a people weighted down with crime, a generation of evil-doers, false-hearted children: they have gone away from the Lord, they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel, their hearts are turned back from him.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> Why will you have more and more punishment? why keep on in your evil ways? Every head is tired and every heart is feeble.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> The body, from head to foot, is all diseased; it is a mass of open wounds, marks of blows, and broken flesh: the flow of blood has not been stopped, and no oil has been put on the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> Your country has become waste; your towns are burned with fire; as for your land, it is overturned before your eyes, made waste and overcome by men from strange lands.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vine-garden, like a watchman&rsquo;s house in a field of fruit, like a town shut in by armies.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe, we would have been like Sodom, and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me? says the Lord; your burned offerings of sheep, and the best parts of fat cattle, are a weariness to me; I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> At whose request do you come before me, making my house unclean with your feet?</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Give me no more false offerings; the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me, so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul: they are a weight in my spirit; I am crushed under them.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> And when your hands are stretched out to me, my eyes will be turned away from you: even though you go on making prayers, I will not give ear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> Be washed, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; let there be an end of sinning;</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> Take pleasure in well-doing; let your ways be upright, keep down the cruel, give a right decision for the child who has no father, see to the cause of the widow.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> Come now, and let us have an argument together, says the Lord: how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow? how may their dark purple seem like wool?</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> If you will give ear to my word and do it, the good things of the land will be yours;</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> But if your hearts are turned against me, I will send destruction on you by the sword; so the Lord has said.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> Your silver is no longer true metal, your wine is mixed with water.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Your chiefs have gone against the Lord, they have become friends of thieves; every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards; they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father, and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them.</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> For this reason the Lord, the Lord of armies, the Strong One of Israel, has said, I will put an end to my haters, and send punishment on those who are against me;</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal;</p>
<p><strong>[1:26]</strong> And I will give you judges again as at the first, and wise guides as in the past; then you will be named, The Town of Righteousness, the true town.</p>
<p><strong>[1:27]</strong> Upright acts will be the price of Zion&rsquo;s forgiveness, and by righteousness will men be living there.</p>
<p><strong>[1:28]</strong> But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil-doers together, and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[1:29]</strong> For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>[1:30]</strong> For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water.</p>
<p><strong>[1:31]</strong> And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> The word which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> And it will come about in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord will be placed on the top of the mountains, and be lifted up over the hills; and all nations will come to it.</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> And the peoples will say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will give us knowledge of his ways, and we will be guided by his word; for out of Zion the law will go out, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> And he will be the judge between the nations, and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions: and their swords will be turned into plough-blades, and their spears into vine-knives: no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another, and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> O family of Jacob, come, and let us go in the light of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> For you, O Lord, have given up your people, the family of Jacob, because they are full of the evil ways of the east, and make use of secret arts like the Philistines, and are friends with the children of strange countries.</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> And their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their stores; their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their carriages.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> Their land is full of images; they give worship to the work of their hands, even to that which their fingers have made.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> And the poor man&rsquo;s head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face: for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin.</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> Go into a hole in the rock, covering yourselves with dust, in fear of the Lord, before the glory of his power.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> The high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low, and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> For the day of the Lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men, and on all who are high and lifted up;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> And on all the high trees of Lebanon, and on all the strong trees of Bashan;</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> And on all the high mountains, and on all the hills which are lifted up;</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> And on every high tower, and on every strong wall;</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all the fair boats.</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> And the high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low: and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day.</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> And the images will never be seen again.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> And men will go into cracks of the rocks, and into holes of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength.</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> In that day men will put their images of silver and of gold, which they made for worship, in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places;</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> To take cover in the cracks of the rocks, and in the holes of the hills, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength.</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> Have no more to do with man, whose life is only a breath, for he is of no value.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah all their support; their store of bread and of water;</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> The strong man and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; the man who has knowledge of secret arts, and the man who is wise because of his years;</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> The captain of fifty, and the man of high position, and the wise guide, and the wonder-worker, and he who makes use of secret powers.</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> And I will make children their chiefs, and foolish ones will have rule over them.</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> And the people will be crushed, every one by his neighbour; the young will be full of pride against the old, and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble.</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> When one man puts his hand on another in his father&rsquo;s house, and says, You have clothing, be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition:</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> Then he will say with an oath, I will not be a helper, for in my house there is no bread or clothing: I will not let you make me a ruler of the people.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> For Jerusalem has become feeble, and destruction has come on Judah, because their words and their acts are against the Lord, moving the eyes of his glory to wrath.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> Their respect for a man&rsquo;s position is a witness against them; and their sin is open to the view of all; like that of Sodom, it is not covered. A curse on their soul! for the measure of their sin is full.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> Happy is the upright man! for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways.</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> Unhappy is the sinner! for the reward of his evil doings will come on him.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> As for my people, their ruler is acting like a child, and those who have authority over them are women. O my people, your guides are the cause of your wandering, turning your footsteps out of the right way.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people, and is about to come forward as their judge.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> The Lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers: it is you who have made waste the vine-garden, and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> By what right are you crushing my people, and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor? This is the word of the Lord, the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> Again, the Lord has said, Because the daughters of Zion are full of pride, and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes, with their foot-chains sounding when they go:</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> The Lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will let their secret parts be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[3:18]</strong> In that day the Lord will take away the glory of their foot-rings, and their sun-jewels, and their moon-ornaments,</p>
<p><strong>[3:19]</strong> The ear-rings, and the chains, and the delicate clothing,</p>
<p><strong>[3:20]</strong> The head-bands, and the arm-chains, and the worked bands, and the perfume-boxes, and the jewels with secret powers,</p>
<p><strong>[3:21]</strong> The rings, and the nose-jewels,</p>
<p><strong>[3:22]</strong> The feast-day dresses, and the robes, and the wide skirts, and the handbags,</p>
<p><strong>[3:23]</strong> The looking-glasses, and the fair linen, and the high head-dresses, and the veils.</p>
<p><strong>[3:24]</strong> And in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell, and for a fair band a thick cord; for a well-dressed head there will be the cutting-off of the hair, and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow; the mark of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free.</p>
<p><strong>[3:25]</strong> Your men will be put to the sword, and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight.</p>
<p><strong>[3:26]</strong> And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping; and she will be seated on the earth, waste and uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> And in that day seven women will put their hands on one man, saying, There will be no need for you to give us food or clothing, only let us go under your name, so that our shame may be taken away.</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> In that day will the young growth of the Lord be beautiful in glory, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride of those who are still living in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> And it will come about that the rest of the living in Zion, and of those who have been kept from destruction in Jerusalem, will be named holy, even everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> When Zion has been washed from her sin by the Lord, and Jerusalem made clean from her blood by a judging and a burning wind.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> And over every living-place on Mount Zion, all over all her meetings, the Lord will make a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all, the glory of the Lord will be a cover and a tent;</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> And a shade in the daytime from the heat, and a safe cover from storm and from rain.</p>
<p><strong>[5:1]</strong> Let me make a song about my loved one, a song of love for his vine-garden. My loved one had a vine-garden on a fertile hill:</p>
<p><strong>[5:2]</strong> And after working the earth of it with a spade, he took away its stones, and put in it a very special vine; and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it, hollowing out in the rock a place for the grape-crushing; and he was hoping that it would give the best grapes, but it gave common grapes.</p>
<p><strong>[5:3]</strong> And now, you people of Jerusalem and you men of Judah, be the judges between me and my vine-garden.</p>
<p><strong>[5:4]</strong> Is there anything which might have been done for my vine-garden which I have not done? why then, when I was hoping for the best grapes did it give me common grapes?</p>
<p><strong>[5:5]</strong> And now, this is what I will do to my vine-garden: I will take away the circle of thorns round it, and it will be burned up; its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it;</p>
<p><strong>[5:6]</strong> And I will make it waste; its branches will not be touched with the knife, or the earth worked with the spade; but blackberries and thorns will come up in it: and I will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it.</p>
<p><strong>[5:7]</strong> For the vine-garden of the Lord of armies is the people of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he was looking for upright judging, and there was blood; for righteousness, and there was a cry for help.</p>
<p><strong>[5:8]</strong> Cursed are those who are joining house to house, and putting field to field, till there is no more living-space for any but themselves in all the land!</p>
<p><strong>[5:9]</strong> The Lord of armies has said to me secretly, Truly, numbers of great and fair houses will be waste, with no one living in them.</p>
<p><strong>[5:10]</strong> For ten fields of vines will only give one measure of wine, and a great amount of seed will only give a small measure of grain.</p>
<p><strong>[5:11]</strong> Cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink; who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine!</p>
<p><strong>[5:12]</strong> And corded instruments and wind-instruments and wine are in their feasts: but they give no thought to the work of the Lord, and they are not interested in what his hands are doing.</p>
<p><strong>[5:13]</strong> For this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge: and their rulers are wasted for need of food, and their loud-voiced feasters are dry for need of water.</p>
<p><strong>[5:14]</strong> For this cause the underworld has made wide its throat, opening its mouth without limit: and her glory, and the noise of her masses, and her loud-voiced feasters, will go down into it.</p>
<p><strong>[5:15]</strong> And the poor man&rsquo;s head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face, and the eyes of pride are put to shame:</p>
<p><strong>[5:16]</strong> But the Lord of armies is lifted up as judge, and the Holy God is seen to be holy in righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[5:17]</strong> Then the lambs will get food as in their grass-lands, and the fat cattle will be feasting in the waste places.</p>
<p><strong>[5:18]</strong> Cursed are those who make use of ox-cords for pulling the evil thing, and the bands of a young ox for their sin!</p>
<p><strong>[5:19]</strong> Who say, Let him do his work quickly, let him make it sudden, so that we may see it: let the design of the Holy One of Israel come near, so that it may be clear to us.</p>
<p><strong>[5:20]</strong> Cursed are those who give the name of good to evil, and of evil to what is good: who make light dark, and dark light: who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter!</p>
<p><strong>[5:21]</strong> Cursed are those who seem wise to themselves, and who take pride in their knowledge!</p>
<p><strong>[5:22]</strong> Cursed are those who are strong to take wine, and great in making mixed drinks!</p>
<p><strong>[5:23]</strong> Who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner, and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him.</p>
<p><strong>[5:24]</strong> For this cause, as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire, and as the dry grass goes down before the flame, so their root will be like the dry stems of grain, and their flower will go up in dust: because they have gone against the law of the Lord of armies, and have given no honour to the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[5:25]</strong> For this reason the wrath of the Lord has been burning against his people, and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment, and the hills were shaking, and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town.</p>
<p><strong>[5:26]</strong> And he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a far-off nation, whistling to them from the ends of the earth: and they will come quickly and suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>[5:27]</strong> There is no weariness among them, and no man is feeble-footed: they come without resting or sleeping, and the cord of their shoes is not broken.</p>
<p><strong>[5:28]</strong> Their arrows are sharp, and every bow is bent: the feet of their horses are like rock, and their wheels are like a rushing storm.</p>
<p><strong>[5:29]</strong> The sound of their armies will be like the voice of a lion, and their war-cry like the noise of young lions: with loud cries they will come down on their food and will take it away safely, and there will be no one to take it out of their hands.</p>
<p><strong>[5:30]</strong> And his voice will be loud over him in that day like the sounding of the sea: and if a man&rsquo;s eyes are turned to the earth, it is all dark and full of trouble; and the light is made dark by thick clouds.</p>
<p><strong>[6:1]</strong> In the year of King Uzziah&rsquo;s death I saw the Lord seated in his place, high and lifted up, and the Temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe.</p>
<p><strong>[6:2]</strong> Over him were the winged ones: every one had six wings; two for covering his face, two for covering his feed, and two for flight.</p>
<p><strong>[6:3]</strong> And one said in a loud voice to another, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of armies: all the earth is full of his glory.</p>
<p><strong>[6:4]</strong> And the bases of the door-pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry, and the house was full of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>[6:5]</strong> Then I said, The curse is on me, and my fate is destruction; for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[6:6]</strong> Then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from off the altar with the fire-spoon.</p>
<p><strong>[6:7]</strong> And after touching my mouth with it, he said, See, your lips have been touched with this; and your evil is taken away, and you are made clean from sin.</p>
<p><strong>[6:8]</strong> And the voice of the Lord came to my ears, saying, Whom am I to send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I, send me.</p>
<p><strong>[6:9]</strong> And he said, Go, and say to this people, You will go on hearing, but learning nothing; you will go on seeing, but without getting wiser.</p>
<p><strong>[6:10]</strong> Make the hearts of this people fat, and let their ears be stopped, and their eyes shut; for fear that they may see with their eyes, and be hearing with their ears, and their heart may become wise, and they may be turned to me and made well.</p>
<p><strong>[6:11]</strong> Then I said, Lord, how long? And he said in answer, Till the towns are waste and unpeopled, and the houses have no men, and the land becomes completely waste,</p>
<p><strong>[6:12]</strong> And the Lord has taken men far away, and there are wide waste places in the land.</p>
<p><strong>[6:13]</strong> And even if there is still a tenth part in it, it will again be burned, like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down (the holy seed is the broken end).</p>
<p><strong>[7:1]</strong> Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, the king of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but were not able to overcome it.</p>
<p><strong>[7:2]</strong> And word came to the family of David that Aram had put up its tents in Ephraim. And the king&rsquo;s heart, and the hearts of his people, were moved, like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>[7:3]</strong> Then the Lord said to Isaiah, Go out now, you and Shear-jashub, your son, and you will come across Ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool, in the highway of the washerman&rsquo;s field;</p>
<p><strong>[7:4]</strong> And say to him, Take care and be quiet; have no fear, and do not let your heart be feeble, because of these two ends of smoking fire-wood, because of the bitter wrath of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.</p>
<p><strong>[7:5]</strong> Because Aram has made evil designs against you, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[7:6]</strong> Let us go up against Judah, troubling her, and forcing our way into her, and let us put up a king in her, even the son of Tabeel:</p>
<p><strong>[7:7]</strong> This is the word of the Lord God: This design will not come about or be effected.</p>
<p><strong>[7:8]</strong> For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin (and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be broken, and will no longer be a people):</p>
<p><strong>[7:9]</strong> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah&rsquo;s son. If you will not have faith, your kingdom will be broken.</p>
<p><strong>[7:10]</strong> And Isaiah said again to Ahaz,</p>
<p><strong>[7:11]</strong> Make a request to the Lord your God for a sign, a sign in the deep places of the underworld, or in the high heavens.</p>
<p><strong>[7:12]</strong> But Ahaz said, I will not put the Lord to the test by making such a request.</p>
<p><strong>[7:13]</strong> And he said, Give ear now, O family of David: is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust? will you do the same to my God?</p>
<p><strong>[7:14]</strong> For this cause the Lord himself will give you a sign; a young woman is now with child, and she will give birth to a son, and she will give him the name Immanuel.</p>
<p><strong>[7:15]</strong> Butter and honey will be his food, when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good.</p>
<p><strong>[7:16]</strong> For before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good, the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste.</p>
<p><strong>[7:17]</strong> The Lord is about to send on you, and on your people, and on your father&rsquo;s house, such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of Ephraim from Judah; even the coming of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[7:18]</strong> And it will be in that day that the Lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[7:19]</strong> And they will come, covering all the waste valleys, and the holes of the rocks, and the thorns, and all the watering-places.</p>
<p><strong>[7:20]</strong> In that day will the Lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet, as well as the hair of the face, with a blade got for a price from the other side of the River; even with the king of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[7:21]</strong> And it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep;</p>
<p><strong>[7:22]</strong> And they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food: for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land.</p>
<p><strong>[7:23]</strong> And it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver, there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns.</p>
<p><strong>[7:24]</strong> Men will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns.</p>
<p><strong>[7:25]</strong> And they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade, &hellip; fear of blackberries and thorns.</p>
<p><strong>[8:1]</strong> And the Lord said to me, Take a great writing-board, and on it put down in common letters, Maher-shalal-hash-baz;</p>
<p><strong>[8:2]</strong> And take true witnesses to the writing, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah.</p>
<p><strong>[8:3]</strong> And I went in to my wife, and she became with child, and gave birth to a son. Then the Lord said to me, Give him the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,</p>
<p><strong>[8:4]</strong> For before the child is able to say, Father, or, Mother, the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[8:5]</strong> And the Lord said again to me,</p>
<p><strong>[8:6]</strong> Because this people will have nothing to do with the softly-flowing waters of Shiloah, and have fear of Rezin and Remaliah&rsquo;s son;</p>
<p><strong>[8:7]</strong> For this cause the Lord is sending on them the waters of the River, deep and strong, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it will come up through all its streams, overflowing all its edges:</p>
<p><strong>[8:8]</strong> And it will come on into Judah; rushing on and overflowing, till the waters are up to the neck; *** and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side: for God is with us.</p>
<p><strong>[8:9]</strong> Have knowledge, O peoples, and be in fear; give ear, all you far-off parts of the earth:</p>
<p><strong>[8:10]</strong> Let your designs be formed, and they will come to nothing; give your orders, and they will not be effected: for God is with us.</p>
<p><strong>[8:11]</strong> For the Lord, controlling me with a strong hand, gave me orders not to go in the way of this people, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[8:12]</strong> Do not say, It is holy, about everything of which this people says, It is holy; and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of.</p>
<p><strong>[8:13]</strong> But let the Lord of armies be holy to you, and go in fear of him, giving honour to him.</p>
<p><strong>[8:14]</strong> And he will be for a holy place: but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel, and to the men of Jerusalem, for a net in which they may be taken.</p>
<p><strong>[8:15]</strong> And numbers of them, falling on the stone, will be broken, and will be taken in the net.</p>
<p><strong>[8:16]</strong> Let my teaching be kept secret: and my words be given to my disciples only.</p>
<p><strong>[8:17]</strong> And I will be waiting for the Lord, whose face is veiled from the house of Jacob, and I will be looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>[8:18]</strong> See, I and the children whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of armies, whose resting-place is in Mount Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[8:19]</strong> And when they say to you, Make request for us to those who have control of spirits, and to those wise in secret arts, who make hollow bird-like sounds; is it not right for a people to make request to their gods, to make request for the living to the dead?</p>
<p><strong>[8:20]</strong> Then say to them, Put your faith in the teaching and the witness. &hellip; If they do not say such things. &hellip; For him there is no dawn. &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>[8:21]</strong> And he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food; and when he is unable to get food, he will become angry, cursing his king and his God, and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high;</p>
<p><strong>[8:22]</strong> And he will be looking down on the earth, and there will be trouble and dark clouds, black night where there is no seeing.</p>
<p><strong>[9:1]</strong> In earlier times he made the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali of small value, but after that he gave it glory, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[9:2]</strong> The people who went in the dark have seen a great light, and for those who were living in the land of the deepest night, the light is shining.</p>
<p><strong>[9:3]</strong> You have made them very glad, increasing their joy. They are glad before you as men are glad in the time of getting in the grain, or when they make division of the goods taken in war.</p>
<p><strong>[9:4]</strong> For by your hand the yoke on his neck and the rod on his back, even the rod of his cruel master, have been broken, as in the day of Midian.</p>
<p><strong>[9:5]</strong> For every boot of the man of war with his sounding step, and the clothing rolled in blood, will be for burning, food for the fire.</p>
<p><strong>[9:6]</strong> For to us a child has come, to us a son is given; and the government has been placed in his hands; and he has been named Wise Guide, Strong God, Father for ever, Prince of Peace.</p>
<p><strong>[9:7]</strong> Of the increase of his rule and of peace there will be no end, on the seat of David, and in his kingdom; to make it strong, supporting it with wise decision and righteousness, now and for ever. By the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.</p>
<p><strong>[9:8]</strong> The Lord has sent a word to Jacob, and it has come on Israel;</p>
<p><strong>[9:9]</strong> And all the people will have experience of it, even Ephraim and the men of Samaria, who say in the pride of their uplifted hearts,</p>
<p><strong>[9:10]</strong> The bricks have come down, but we will put up buildings of cut stone in their place: the sycamores are cut down, but they will be changed to cedars.</p>
<p><strong>[9:11]</strong> For this cause the Lord has made strong the haters of Israel, driving them on to make war against him;</p>
<p><strong>[9:12]</strong> Aram on the east, and the Philistines on the west, who have come against Israel with open mouths. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
<p><strong>[9:13]</strong> But the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them, and they made no prayer to the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[9:14]</strong> For this cause the Lord took away from Israel head and tail, high and low, in one day.</p>
<p><strong>[9:15]</strong> The man who is honoured and responsible is the head, and the prophet who gives false teaching is the tail.</p>
<p><strong>[9:16]</strong> For the guides of this people are the cause of their wandering from the right way, and those who are guided by them come to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[9:17]</strong> For this cause the Lord will have no pleasure in their young men, and no pity on their widows and the children without fathers: for they are all haters of God and evil-doers, and foolish words come from every mouth. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
<p><strong>[9:18]</strong> For evil was burning like a fire; the blackberries and thorns were burned up; the thick woods took fire, rolling up in dark clouds of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>[9:19]</strong> The land was dark with the wrath of the Lord of armies: the people were like those who take men&rsquo;s flesh for food.</p>
<p><strong>[9:20]</strong> On the right a man was cutting off bits and was still in need; on the left a man took a meal but had not enough; no man had pity on his brother; every man was making a meal of the flesh of his neighbour.</p>
<p><strong>[9:21]</strong> Manasseh was making a meal of Ephraim, and Ephraim of Manasseh; and together they were attacking Judah. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
<p><strong>[10:1]</strong> Cursed are those who make evil decisions, and the writers who make the records of their cruel acts:</p>
<p><strong>[10:2]</strong> Who do wrong to the poor in their cause, and take away the right of the crushed among my people, so that they may have the property of widows, and get under their power those who have no father.</p>
<p><strong>[10:3]</strong> And what will you do in the day of punishment, and in the destruction which is coming from far? to whom will you go for help, and what will become of your glory?</p>
<p><strong>[10:4]</strong> &hellip; For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
<p><strong>[10:5]</strong> Ho! Assyrian, the rod of my wrath, the instrument of my punishment!</p>
<p><strong>[10:6]</strong> I will send him against a nation of wrongdoers, and against the people of my wrath I will give him orders, to take their wealth in war, crushing them down like the dust in the streets.</p>
<p><strong>[10:7]</strong> But this is not what is in his mind, and this is not his design; but his purpose is destruction, and the cutting off of more and more nations.</p>
<p><strong>[10:8]</strong> For he says, Are not all my captains kings?</p>
<p><strong>[10:9]</strong> Will not the fate of Calno be like that of Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</p>
<p><strong>[10:10]</strong> As my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images, whose pictured images were more in number than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;</p>
<p><strong>[10:11]</strong> So, as I have done to Samaria and her images, I will do to Jerusalem and her images.</p>
<p><strong>[10:12]</strong> For this cause it will be that, when the purpose of the Lord against Mount Zion and Jerusalem is complete, I will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of Assyria, and on the glory of his uplifted eyes.</p>
<p><strong>[10:13]</strong> For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my knowledge, for I am wise: and I have taken away the limits of the peoples&rsquo; lands, and the stores of their wealth have become mine; and I have made towns low in the dust, sending destruction on those living in them;</p>
<p><strong>[10:14]</strong> And I have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples, as on the place where a bird has put her eggs; and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone, so I have taken all the earth for myself: and not a wing was moved, and not a mouth gave out a sound.</p>
<p><strong>[10:15]</strong> Will the axe say high-sounding words against him who is using it, or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it? As if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it, or as if a stick might take up him who is not wood.</p>
<p><strong>[10:16]</strong> For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, will make his fat become wasted; and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame.</p>
<p><strong>[10:17]</strong> And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: wasting and burning up his thorns in one day.</p>
<p><strong>[10:18]</strong> And he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields, soul and body together; and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease.</p>
<p><strong>[10:19]</strong> And the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number, so that a child may put them down in writing.</p>
<p><strong>[10:20]</strong> And it will be in that day that the rest of Israel, and those of Jacob who have come safely through these troubles, will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back, but their faith will be in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[10:21]</strong> The rest, even the rest of Jacob, will come back to the Strong God.</p>
<p><strong>[10:22]</strong> For though your people, O Israel, are as the sand of the sea, only a small number will come back: for the destruction is fixed, overflowing in righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[10:23]</strong> For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to make destruction complete in all the land.</p>
<p><strong>[10:24]</strong> For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, says, O my people living in Zion, have no fear of the Assyrian, even if his rod comes on your back, and his stick is lifted up as in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[10:25]</strong> For in a very short time my passion will be over, and my wrath will be turned to their destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[10:26]</strong> And the Lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him, as when he overcame Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the Egyptians.</p>
<p><strong>[10:27]</strong> And in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away, and his yoke broken from off your neck.</p>
<p><strong>[10:28]</strong> He has gone up from Pene-Rimmon, he has come to Aiath; he has gone past Migron, at Michmash he puts his forces in order.</p>
<p><strong>[10:29]</strong> They have gone across the mountain; Geba will be our resting-place tonight, they say: Ramah is shaking with fear; Gibeah of Saul has gone in flight.</p>
<p><strong>[10:30]</strong> Give a loud cry, daughter of Gallim; let Laishah give ear; let Anathoth give answer to her.</p>
<p><strong>[10:31]</strong> Madmenah has gone; the men of Gebim are putting their goods in a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>[10:32]</strong> This very day he is stopping at Nob; he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[10:33]</strong> See, the Lord, the Lord of armies, is cutting off his branches with a great noise, and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down.</p>
<p><strong>[10:34]</strong> And he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon with its tall trees is coming down.</p>
<p><strong>[11:1]</strong> And there will come a rod out of the broken tree of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will give fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[11:2]</strong> And the spirit of the Lord will be resting on him, the spirit of wisdom and good sense, the spirit of wise guiding and strength, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;</p>
<p><strong>[11:3]</strong> And he will not be guided in his judging by what he sees, or give decisions by the hearing of his ears:</p>
<p><strong>[11:4]</strong> But he will do right in the cause of the poor, and give wise decisions for those in the land who are in need; and the rod of his mouth will come down on the cruel, and with the breath of his lips he will put an end to the evil-doer.</p>
<p><strong>[11:5]</strong> And righteousness will be the cord of his robe, and good faith the band round his breast.</p>
<p><strong>[11:6]</strong> And the wolf will be living with the lamb, and the leopard will take his rest with the young goat; and the lion will take grass for food like the ox; and the young lion will go with the young ones of the herd; and a little child will be their guide.</p>
<p><strong>[11:7]</strong> And the cow and the bear will be friends while their young ones are sleeping together.</p>
<p><strong>[11:8]</strong> And the child at the breast will be playing by the hole of the snake, and the older child will put his hand on the bright eye of the poison-snake.</p>
<p><strong>[11:9]</strong> There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain: for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters.</p>
<p><strong>[11:10]</strong> And in that day, the eyes of the nations will be turned to the root of Jesse which will be lifted up as the flag of the peoples; and his resting-place will be glory.</p>
<p><strong>[11:11]</strong> And in that day the hand of the Lord will be stretched out the second time to get back the rest of his people, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the sea-lands.</p>
<p><strong>[11:12]</strong> And he will put up a flag as a sign to the nations, and he will get together those of Israel who had been sent away, and the wandering ones of Judah, from the four ends of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[11:13]</strong> And the envy of Ephraim will be gone, and those who make trouble for Judah will come to an end: Ephraim will have no more envy of Judah, and there will be an end of Judah&rsquo;s hate for Ephraim.</p>
<p><strong>[11:14]</strong> And they will be united in attacking the Philistines on the west, and together they will take the goods of the children of the east: their hand will be on Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon will be under their rule.</p>
<p><strong>[11:15]</strong> And the Lord will make the tongue of the Egyptian sea completely dry; and with his burning wind his hand will be stretched out over the River, and it will be parted into seven streams, so that men may go over it with dry feet.</p>
<p><strong>[11:16]</strong> And there will be a highway for the rest of his people from Assyria; as there was for Israel in the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[12:1]</strong> And in that day you will say I will give praise to you, O Lord; for though you were angry with me, your wrath is turned away, and I am comforted.</p>
<p><strong>[12:2]</strong> See, God is my salvation; I will have faith in the Lord, without fear: for the Lord Jah is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[12:3]</strong> So with joy will you get water out of the springs of salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[12:4]</strong> And in that day you will say, Give praise to the Lord, let his name be honoured, give word of his doings among the peoples, say that his name is lifted up.</p>
<p><strong>[12:5]</strong> Make a song to the Lord; for he has done noble things: give news of them through all the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[12:6]</strong> Let your voice be sounding in a cry of joy, O daughter of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.</p>
<p><strong>[13:1]</strong> The word of the Lord about Babylon which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw.</p>
<p><strong>[13:2]</strong> Put up a flag on a clear mountain-top, make a loud outcry to them, give directions with the hand, so that they may go into the doors of the great ones.</p>
<p><strong>[13:3]</strong> I have given orders to my holy ones, I have sent out my men of war, those of mine who take pride in their power, to give effect to my wrath.</p>
<p><strong>[13:4]</strong> The noise of great numbers in the mountains, like the noise of a strong people! The noise of the kingdoms of the nations meeting together! The Lord of armies is numbering his forces for war.</p>
<p><strong>[13:5]</strong> They come from a far country, from the farthest part of heaven, even the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, with destruction for all the land.</p>
<p><strong>[13:6]</strong> Send out a cry of grief; for the day of the Lord is near; it comes as destruction from the Most High.</p>
<p><strong>[13:7]</strong> For this cause all hands will be feeble, and every heart of man be turned to water;</p>
<p><strong>[13:8]</strong> Their hearts will be full of fear; pains and sorrows will overcome them; they will be in pain like a woman in childbirth; they will be shocked at one another; their faces will be like flames.</p>
<p><strong>[13:9]</strong> See, the day of the Lord is coming, cruel, with wrath and burning passion: to make the land a waste, driving the sinners in it to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[13:10]</strong> For the stars of heaven and its bright armies will not give their light: the sun will be made dark in his journey through the heaven, and the moon will keep back her light.</p>
<p><strong>[13:11]</strong> And I will send punishment on the world for its evil, and on the sinners for their wrongdoing; and I will put an end to all pride, and will make low the power of the cruel.</p>
<p><strong>[13:12]</strong> I will make men so small in number, that a man will be harder to get than gold, even the best gold of Ophir.</p>
<p><strong>[13:13]</strong> For this cause the heavens will be shaking, and the earth will be moved out of its place, in the wrath of the Lord of armies, and in the day of his burning passion.</p>
<p><strong>[13:14]</strong> And it will be that, like a roe in flight, and like wandering sheep, they will go every man to his people and to his land.</p>
<p><strong>[13:15]</strong> Everyone who is overtaken will have a spear put through him, and everyone who goes in flight will be put to the sword.</p>
<p><strong>[13:16]</strong> Their young children will be broken up before their eyes; their goods will be taken away, and their wives made the property of others.</p>
<p><strong>[13:17]</strong> See, I am driving the Medes against them, who put no value on silver and have no pleasure in gold.</p>
<p><strong>[13:18]</strong> In their hands are bows and spears; they are cruel, violently putting the young men to death, and crushing the young women; they have no pity for children, and no mercy for the fruit of the body.</p>
<p><strong>[13:19]</strong> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beautiful town which is the pride of the Chaldaeans, will be like God&rsquo;s destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>[13:20]</strong> People will never be living in it again, and it will have no more men from generation to generation: the Arab will not put up his tent there; and those who keep sheep will not make it a resting-place for their flocks.</p>
<p><strong>[13:21]</strong> But the beasts of the waste land will have their holes there; and the houses will be full of crying jackals, and ostriches will have their place there, and evil spirits will be dancing there.</p>
<p><strong>[13:22]</strong> And wolves will be answering one another in their towers, and jackals in their houses of pleasure: her time is near, and her days of power will quickly be ended.</p>
<p><strong>[14:1]</strong> For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will again make Israel his special people, and will put them in their land; and the man from a strange country will take his place among them and be joined to the family of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[14:2]</strong> And the people will take them with them to their place: and the children of Israel will give them a heritage in the Lord&rsquo;s land as men-servants and women-servants, making them prisoners whose prisoners they were; and they will be rulers over their masters.</p>
<p><strong>[14:3]</strong> And it will be, in the day when the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow, and from your trouble, and from the hard yoke which they had put on you,</p>
<p><strong>[14:4]</strong> That you will take up this bitter song against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the cruel overseer come to an end! He who was lifted up in pride is cut off;</p>
<p><strong>[14:5]</strong> The stick of the evil-doers, the rod of the rulers, is broken by the Lord;</p>
<p><strong>[14:6]</strong> He whose rod was on the peoples with an unending wrath, ruling the nations in passion, with an uncontrolled rule.</p>
<p><strong>[14:7]</strong> All the earth is at rest and is quiet: they are bursting into song.</p>
<p><strong>[14:8]</strong> Even the trees of the wood are glad over you, the trees of Lebanon, saying, From the time of your fall no wood-cutter has come up against us with an axe.</p>
<p><strong>[14:9]</strong> The underworld is moved at your coming: the shades of the dead are awake before you, even the strong ones of the earth; all the kings of the world have got up from their seats.</p>
<p><strong>[14:10]</strong> They all make answer and say to you, Have you become feeble like us? have you been made even as we are?</p>
<p><strong>[14:11]</strong> Your pride has gone down into the underworld, and the noise of your instruments of music; the worms are under you, and your body is covered with them.</p>
<p><strong>[14:12]</strong> How great is your fall from heaven, O shining one, son of the morning! How are you cut down to the earth, low among the dead bodies!</p>
<p><strong>[14:13]</strong> For you said in your heart, I will go up to heaven, I will make my seat higher than the stars of God; I will take my place on the mountain of the meeting-place of the gods, in the inmost parts of the north.</p>
<p><strong>[14:14]</strong> I will go higher than the clouds; I will be like the Most High.</p>
<p><strong>[14:15]</strong> But you will come down to the underworld, even to its inmost parts.</p>
<p><strong>[14:16]</strong> Those who see you will be looking on you with care, they will be in deep thought, saying, Is this the troubler of the earth, the shaker of kingdoms?</p>
<p><strong>[14:17]</strong> Who made the world a waste, overturning its towns; who did not let his prisoners loose from the prison-house.</p>
<p><strong>[14:18]</strong> All the kings of the earth are at rest in glory, every man in his house,</p>
<p><strong>[14:19]</strong> But you, like a birth before its time, are stretched out with no resting-place in the earth; clothed with the bodies of the dead who have been put to the sword, who go down to the lowest parts of the underworld; a dead body, crushed under foot.</p>
<p><strong>[14:20]</strong> As for your fathers, you will not be united with them in their resting-place, because you have been the cause of destruction to your land, and of death to your people; the seed of the evil-doer will have no place in the memory of man.</p>
<p><strong>[14:21]</strong> Make ready a place of death for his children, because of the evil-doing of their father; so that they may not come up and take the earth for their heritage, covering the face of the world with waste places.</p>
<p><strong>[14:22]</strong> For I will come up against them, says the Lord of armies, cutting off from Babylon name and offspring, son and son&rsquo;s son, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[14:23]</strong> And I will make you a heritage for the hedgehog, and pools of water: and I will go through it with the brush of destruction, says the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[14:24]</strong> The Lord has taken an oath, saying, My design will certainly come about, and my purpose will be effected:</p>
<p><strong>[14:25]</strong> To let the Assyrian be broken in my land, and crushed under foot on my mountains: there will his yoke be taken away from them, and his rule over them come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[14:26]</strong> This is the purpose for all the earth: and this is the hand stretched out over all nations.</p>
<p><strong>[14:27]</strong> For it is the purpose of the Lord of armies, and who will make it of no effect? when his hand is stretched out, by whom may it be turned back?</p>
<p><strong>[14:28]</strong> In the year of the death of King Ahaz this word came to the prophet:</p>
<p><strong>[14:29]</strong> Be not glad, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod which was on you is broken: for out of the snake&rsquo;s root will come a poison-snake, and its fruit will be a winged poison-snake.</p>
<p><strong>[14:30]</strong> And the poorest of the land will have food, and those in need will be given a safe resting-place: but your seed will come to an end for need of food, and the rest of you will be put to the sword.</p>
<p><strong>[14:31]</strong> Send out a cry, O door! Make sounds of sorrow, O town! All your land has come to nothing, O Philistia; for there comes a smoke out of the north, and everyone keeps his place in the line.</p>
<p><strong>[14:32]</strong> What answer, then, will my people give to the representatives of the nation? That the Lord is the builder of Zion, and she will be a safe place for the poor of his people.</p>
<p><strong>[15:1]</strong> The word about Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer; for in a night Kir of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer.</p>
<p><strong>[15:2]</strong> The daughter of Dibon has gone up to the high places, weeping: Moab is sounding her cry of sorrow over Nebo, and over Medeba: everywhere the hair of the head and of the face is cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[15:3]</strong> In their streets they are covering themselves with haircloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their public places, there is crying and bitter weeping.</p>
<p><strong>[15:4]</strong> Heshbon is crying out, and Elealeh; their voice is sounding even to Jahaz: for this cause the heart of Moab is shaking; his soul is shaking with fear.</p>
<p><strong>[15:5]</strong> My heart is crying out for Moab; her people go in flight to Zoar, and to Eglath-shelishiyah: for they go up with weeping by the slope of Luhith; on the way to Horonaim they send up a cry of destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[15:6]</strong> The waters of Nimrim will become dry: for the grass is burned up, the young grass is coming to an end, every green thing is dead.</p>
<p><strong>[15:7]</strong> For this cause they will take away their wealth, and the stores they have got together, over the stream of the water-plants.</p>
<p><strong>[15:8]</strong> For the cry has gone round the limits of Moab; as far as to Eglaim and Beer-elim.</p>
<p><strong>[15:9]</strong> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood: and I&rsquo;m sending even more on Moab, a lion on those of Moab who go in flight, and on the rest of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[16:1]</strong> And they will send &hellip; to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[16:2]</strong> For the daughters of Moab will be like wandering birds, like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight, at the ways across the Arnon.</p>
<p><strong>[16:3]</strong> Give wise directions, make a decision; let your shade be as night in full day: keep safe those who are in flight; do not give up the wandering ones.</p>
<p><strong>[16:4]</strong> Let those who have been forced out of Moab have a resting-place with you; be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land: till the cruel ones are cut off, and wasting has come to an end, and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land.</p>
<p><strong>[16:5]</strong> Then a king&rsquo;s seat will be based on mercy, and one will be seated on it in the tent of David for ever; judging uprightly, and quick to do righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[16:6]</strong> We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride and passion: his high words about himself are false.</p>
<p><strong>[16:7]</strong> For this cause everyone in Moab will give cries of grief for Moab: crushed to the earth, they will be weeping for the men of Kir-hareseth.</p>
<p><strong>[16:8]</strong> For the fields of Heshbon are waste, the vine of Sibmah is dead; the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines; her vine-plants went as far as Jazer, and came even to the waste land; her branches were stretched out to the sea.</p>
<p><strong>[16:9]</strong> For this cause my sorrow for the vine of Sibmah will be like the weeping for Jazer: my eyes are dropping water on you, O Heshbon and Elealeh! For they are sounding the war-cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain;</p>
<p><strong>[16:10]</strong> And all joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field; and in the vine-gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy: the crushing of grapes has come to an end, and its glad cry has been stopped.</p>
<p><strong>[16:11]</strong> For this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for Moab, and I am full of sorrow for Kir-heres.</p>
<p><strong>[16:12]</strong> And when Moab goes up to the high place, and makes prayer in the house of his god, it will have no effect.</p>
<p><strong>[16:13]</strong> This is the word which the Lord said about Moab in the past.</p>
<p><strong>[16:14]</strong> But now the Lord has said, In three years, the years of a servant working for payment, the glory of Moab, all that great people, will be turned to shame, and the rest of Moab will be very small and without honour.</p>
<p><strong>[17:1]</strong> The word about Damascus. See, they have made Damascus a town no longer; it has become a waste place.</p>
<p><strong>[17:2]</strong> Her towns are unpeopled for ever; there the flocks take their rest in peace, without fear.</p>
<p><strong>[17:3]</strong> The strong tower has gone from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus: the rest of Aram will come to destruction, and be made like the glory of the children of Israel, says the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[17:4]</strong> And it will be in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made small, and the strength of his body will become feeble.</p>
<p><strong>[17:5]</strong> And it will be like a man cutting the growth of his grain, pulling together the heads of the grain with his arm; even as when they get in the grain in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p><strong>[17:6]</strong> But it will be like a man shaking an olive-tree, something will still be there, two or three berries on the top of the highest branch, four or five on the outside branches of a fertile tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[17:7]</strong> In that day a man&rsquo;s heart will be turned to his Maker, and his eyes to the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[17:8]</strong> He will not be looking to the altars, the work of his hands, or to the wood pillars or to the sun-images which his fingers have made.</p>
<p><strong>[17:9]</strong> In that day your towns will be like the waste places of the Hivites and the Amorites which the children of Israel took for a heritage, and they will come to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[17:10]</strong> For you have not given honour to the God of your salvation, and have not kept in mind the Rock of your strength; for this cause you made a garden of Adonis, and put in it the vine-cuttings of a strange god;</p>
<p><strong>[17:11]</strong> In the day of your planting you were watching its growth, and in the morning your seed was flowering: but its fruit is wasted away in the day of grief and bitter sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>[17:12]</strong> Ah! the voice of peoples, like the loud sounding of the seas, and the thundering of great nations rushing on like the bursting out of waters!</p>
<p><strong>[17:13]</strong> But he will put a stop to them, and make them go in flight far away, driving them like the waste of the grain on the tops of the mountains before the wind, and like the circling dust before the storm.</p>
<p><strong>[17:14]</strong> In the evening there is fear, and in the morning they are gone. This is the fate of those who take our goods, and the reward of those who violently take our property for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>[18:1]</strong> Ho! land of the sounding of wings, on the other side of the rivers of Ethiopia:</p>
<p><strong>[18:2]</strong> Which sends its representatives by the sea, even in ships of papyrus on the waters. Go back quickly, O representatives, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people causing fear through all their history; a strong nation, crushing down its haters, whose land is cut through by rivers.</p>
<p><strong>[18:3]</strong> All you peoples of the world, and you who are living on the earth, when a flag is lifted up on the mountains, give attention; and when the horn is sounded, give ear.</p>
<p><strong>[18:4]</strong> For this is what the Lord has said to me: I will be quiet, watching from my place; like the clear heat when the sun is shining, like a mist of dew in the heat of summer.</p>
<p><strong>[18:5]</strong> For before the time of getting in the grapes, after the opening of the bud, when the flower has become a grape ready for crushing, he will take away the small branches with knives, cutting down and taking away the wide-stretching branches.</p>
<p><strong>[18:6]</strong> They will be for the birds of the mountains, and for the beasts of the earth: the birds will come down on them in the summer, and the beasts of the earth in the winter.</p>
<p><strong>[18:7]</strong> In that time an offering will be made to the Lord of armies from a people tall and smooth, causing fear through all their history; a strong nation, crushing down its haters, whose land is cut through by rivers, an offering taken to the place of the name of the Lord of armies, even Mount Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[19:1]</strong> The word about Egypt. See, the Lord is seated on a quick-moving cloud, and is coming to Egypt: and the false gods of Egypt will be troubled at his coming, and the heart of Egypt will be turned to water.</p>
<p><strong>[19:2]</strong> And I will send the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they will be fighting every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; town against town, and kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>[19:3]</strong> And the spirit of Egypt will be troubled in her, and I will make her decisions without effect: and they will be turning to the false gods, and to those who make hollow sounds, and to those who have control of spirits, and to those who are wise in secret arts.</p>
<p><strong>[19:4]</strong> And I will give the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a hard king will be their ruler, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[19:5]</strong> And the waters of the sea will be cut off, and the river will become dry and waste:</p>
<p><strong>[19:6]</strong> And the rivers will have an evil smell; the stream of Egypt will become small and dry: all the water-plants will come to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[19:7]</strong> The grass-lands by the Nile, and everything planted by the Nile, will become dry, or taken away by the wind, and will come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[19:8]</strong> The fishermen will be sad, and all those who put fishing-lines into the Nile will be full of grief, and those whose nets are stretched out on the waters will have sorrow in their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>[19:9]</strong> And all the workers in linen thread, and those who make cotton cloth, will be put to shame.</p>
<p><strong>[19:10]</strong> And the makers of twisted thread will be crushed, and those who &hellip; will be sad in heart.</p>
<p><strong>[19:11]</strong> The chiefs of Zoan are completely foolish; the wisest guides of Pharaoh have become like beasts: how do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the offspring of early kings?</p>
<p><strong>[19:12]</strong> Where, then, are your wise men? let them make clear to you, let them give you knowledge of the purpose of the Lord of armies for Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[19:13]</strong> The chiefs of Zoan have become foolish, the chiefs of Noph are tricked, the heads of her tribes are the cause of Egypt&rsquo;s wandering out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>[19:14]</strong> The Lord has sent among them a spirit of error: and by them Egypt is turned out of the right way in all her doings, as a man overcome by wine is uncertain in his steps.</p>
<p><strong>[19:15]</strong> And in Egypt there will be no work for any man, head or tail, high or low, to do.</p>
<p><strong>[19:16]</strong> In that day the Egyptians will be like women: and the land will be shaking with fear because of the waving of the Lord&rsquo;s hand stretched out over it.</p>
<p><strong>[19:17]</strong> And the land of Judah will become a cause of great fear to Egypt; whenever its name comes to mind, Egypt will be in fear before the Lord of armies because of his purpose against it.</p>
<p><strong>[19:18]</strong> In that day there will be five towns in the land of Egypt using the language of Canaan, and making oaths to the Lord of armies; and one of them will be named, The Town of the Sun.</p>
<p><strong>[19:19]</strong> In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at the edge of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[19:20]</strong> And it will be a sign and a witness to the Lord of armies in the land of Egypt: when they are crying out to the Lord because of their cruel masters, then he will send them a saviour and a strong one to make them free.</p>
<p><strong>[19:21]</strong> And the Lord will give the knowledge of himself to Egypt, and the Egyptians will give honour to the Lord in that day; they will give him worship with offerings and meal offerings, and will take an oath to the Lord and give effect to it.</p>
<p><strong>[19:22]</strong> And the Lord will send punishment on Egypt, and will make them well again; and when they come back to the Lord he will give ear to their prayer and take away their disease.</p>
<p><strong>[19:23]</strong> In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt will come into Assyria; and the Egyptians will give worship to the Lord together with the Assyrians.</p>
<p><strong>[19:24]</strong> In that day Israel will be the third together with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the earth:</p>
<p><strong>[19:25]</strong> Because of the blessing of the Lord of armies which he has given them, saying, A blessing on Egypt my people, and on Assyria the work of my hands, and on Israel my heritage.</p>
<p><strong>[20:1]</strong> In the year when the Tartan came to Ashdod, sent by Sargon, king of Assyria, and made war against it and took it;</p>
<p><strong>[20:2]</strong> At that time the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and take off your robe, and your shoes from your feet; and he did so, walking unclothed and without shoes on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>[20:3]</strong> And the Lord said, As my servant Isaiah has gone unclothed and without shoes for three years as a sign and a wonder to Egypt and Ethiopia,</p>
<p><strong>[20:4]</strong> So will the king of Assyria take away the prisoners of Egypt and those forced out of Ethiopia, young and old, unclothed and without shoes, and with backs uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[20:5]</strong> And they will be full of fear, and will no longer have faith in Ethiopia which was their hope, or in Egypt which was their glory.</p>
<p><strong>[20:6]</strong> And those living by the sea will say in that day, See the fate of our hope to whom we went for help and salvation from the king of Assyria: what hope have we then of salvation?</p>
<p><strong>[21:1]</strong> The word about the waste land. As storm-winds in the South go rushing through, it comes from the waste land, from the land greatly to be feared.</p>
<p><strong>[21:2]</strong> A vision of fear comes before my eyes; the worker of deceit goes on in his false way, and the waster goes on making waste. Up! Elam; to the attack! Media; I have put an end to her sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>[21:3]</strong> For this cause I am full of bitter grief; pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me: I am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears; I am shocked by what I see.</p>
<p><strong>[21:4]</strong> My mind is wandering, fear has overcome me: the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me.</p>
<p><strong>[21:5]</strong> They make ready the table, they put down the covers, they take food and drink. Up! you captains; put oil on your breastplates.</p>
<p><strong>[21:6]</strong> For so has the Lord said to me, Go, let a watchman be placed; let him give word of what he sees:</p>
<p><strong>[21:7]</strong> And when he sees war-carriages, horsemen by twos, war-carriages with asses, war-carriages with camels, let him give special attention.</p>
<p><strong>[21:8]</strong> And the watchman gave a loud cry, O my lord, I am on the watchtower all day, and am placed in my watch every night:</p>
<p><strong>[21:9]</strong> See, here come war-carriages with men, horsemen by twos: and in answer he said, Babylon is made low, is made low, and all her images are broken on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[21:10]</strong> O my crushed ones, the grain of my floor! I have given you the word which came to me from the Lord of armies, the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[21:11]</strong> The word about Edom. A voice comes to me from Seir, Watchman, how far gone is the night? how far gone is the night?</p>
<p><strong>[21:12]</strong> The watchman says, The morning has come, but night is still to come: if you have questions to put, put them, and come back again.</p>
<p><strong>[21:13]</strong> The word about Arabia. In the thick woods of Arabia will be your night&rsquo;s resting-place, O travelling bands of Dedanites!</p>
<p><strong>[21:14]</strong> Give water to him who is in need of water; give bread, O men of the land of Tema, to those in flight.</p>
<p><strong>[21:15]</strong> For they are in flight from the sharp sword, and the bent bow, and from the trouble of war.</p>
<p><strong>[21:16]</strong> For so has the Lord said to me, In a year, by the years of a servant working for payment, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end:</p>
<p><strong>[21:17]</strong> And the rest of the bowmen, the men of war of the children of Kedar, will be small in number: for the Lord, the God of Israel, has said it.</p>
<p><strong>[22:1]</strong> The word about the valley of vision. Why have all your people gone up to the house-tops?</p>
<p><strong>[22:2]</strong> You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war.</p>
<p><strong>[22:3]</strong> All your rulers &hellip; have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away.</p>
<p><strong>[22:4]</strong> For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p><strong>[22:5]</strong> For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the valley of vision; &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>[22:6]</strong> And Elam was armed with arrows, and Aram came on horseback; and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>[22:7]</strong> And your most fertile valleys were full of war-carriages, and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town.</p>
<p><strong>[22:8]</strong> He took away the cover of Judah; and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods.</p>
<p><strong>[22:9]</strong> And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David: and you got together the waters of the lower pool.</p>
<p><strong>[22:10]</strong> And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger.</p>
<p><strong>[22:11]</strong> And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before.</p>
<p><strong>[22:12]</strong> And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief:</p>
<p><strong>[22:13]</strong> But in place of these there was joy and delight, oxen and sheep were being made ready for food, there was feasting and drinking: men said, Now is the time for food and wine, for tomorrow death comes.</p>
<p><strong>[22:14]</strong> And the Lord of armies said to me secretly, Truly, this sin will not be taken from you till your death, says the Lord, the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[22:15]</strong> The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say,</p>
<p><strong>[22:16]</strong> Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here?</p>
<p><strong>[22:17]</strong> See, O strong man, the Lord will send you violently away, gripping you with force,</p>
<p><strong>[22:18]</strong> Twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country: there you will come to your end, and there will be the carriages of your pride, O shame of your lord&rsquo;s house!</p>
<p><strong>[22:19]</strong> And I will have you forced out of your place of authority, and pulled down from your position.</p>
<p><strong>[22:20]</strong> And in that day I will send for my servant, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah:</p>
<p><strong>[22:21]</strong> And I will put your robe on him, and put your band about him, and I will give your authority into his hand: and he will be a father to the men of Jerusalem, and to the family of Judah.</p>
<p><strong>[22:22]</strong> And I will give the key of the family of David into his care; and what he keeps open will be shut by no one, and what he keeps shut no one will make open.</p>
<p><strong>[22:23]</strong> And I will put him like a nail in a safe place; and he will be for a seat of glory to his father&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p><strong>[22:24]</strong> And all the glory of his father&rsquo;s family will be hanging on him, all their offspring, every small vessel, even the cups and the basins.</p>
<p><strong>[22:25]</strong> In that day, says the Lord of armies, will the nail fixed in a safe place give way; and it will be cut down, and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has said it.</p>
<p><strong>[23:1]</strong> The word about Tyre. Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish, because your strong place is made waste; on the way back from the land of Kittim the news is given to them.</p>
<p><strong>[23:2]</strong> Send out a cry of grief, you men of the sea-land, traders of Zidon, who go over the sea, whose representatives are on great waters;</p>
<p><strong>[23:3]</strong> Who get in the seed of Shihor, whose wealth is the trade of the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[23:4]</strong> Be shamed, O Zidon: for the sea, the strong place of the sea has said, I have not been with child, or given birth; I have not taken care of young men, or kept watch over the growth of virgins.</p>
<p><strong>[23:5]</strong> When the news comes to Egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of Tyre.</p>
<p><strong>[23:6]</strong> Go over to Tarshish; give cries of sorrow, O men of the sea-land.</p>
<p><strong>[23:7]</strong> Is this the town which was full of joy, whose start goes back to times long past, whose wanderings took her into far-off countries?</p>
<p><strong>[23:8]</strong> By whom was this purposed against Tyre, the crowning town, whose traders are chiefs, whose business men are honoured in the land?</p>
<p><strong>[23:9]</strong> It was the purpose of the Lord of armies to put pride to shame, to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[23:10]</strong> Let your land be worked with the plough, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer any harbour.</p>
<p><strong>[23:11]</strong> His hand is stretched out over the sea, the kingdoms are shaking: the Lord has given orders about Canaan, to make waste its strong places.</p>
<p><strong>[23:12]</strong> And he said, There is no more joy for you, O crushed virgin daughter of Zidon: up! go over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest.</p>
<p><strong>[23:13]</strong> &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>[23:14]</strong> Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish: because your strong place is made waste.</p>
<p><strong>[23:15]</strong> And it will be in that day that Tyre will go out of mind for seventy years, that is, the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it will be for Tyre as in the song of the loose woman.</p>
<p><strong>[23:16]</strong> Take an instrument of music, go about the town, O loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man; make sweet melody with songs, so that you may come back to men&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p><strong>[23:17]</strong> And it will be after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre, and she will go back to her trade, acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[23:18]</strong> And her goods and her trade will be holy to the Lord: they will not be kept back or stored up; for her produce will be for those living in the Lord&rsquo;s land, to give them food for their needs, and fair clothing.</p>
<p><strong>[24:1]</strong> See, the Lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled, he is turning it upside down, and sending the people in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>[24:2]</strong> And it will be the same for the people as for the priest; for the servant as for his master; and for the woman-servant as for her owner; the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them; the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it; the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it.</p>
<p><strong>[24:3]</strong> The earth will be completely waste and without men; for this is the word of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[24:4]</strong> The earth is sorrowing and wasting away, the world is full of grief and wasting away, the high ones of the earth come to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[24:5]</strong> The earth has been made unclean by those living in it; because the laws have not been kept by them, the orders have been changed, and the eternal agreement has been broken.</p>
<p><strong>[24:6]</strong> For this cause the earth is given up to the curse, and those in it are judged as sinners: for this cause those living on the earth are burned up, and the rest are small in number.</p>
<p><strong>[24:7]</strong> The new wine is thin, the vine is feeble, and all the glad-hearted make sounds of grief.</p>
<p><strong>[24:8]</strong> The pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end, and the voices of those who are glad.</p>
<p><strong>[24:9]</strong> There is no more drinking of wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who take it.</p>
<p><strong>[24:10]</strong> The town is waste and broken down: every house is shut up, so that no man may come in.</p>
<p><strong>[24:11]</strong> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; there is an end of all delight, the joy of the land is gone.</p>
<p><strong>[24:12]</strong> In the town all is waste, and in the public place is destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[24:13]</strong> For it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive-tree, as the last of the grapes after the getting-in is done.</p>
<p><strong>[24:14]</strong> But those will be making sounds of joy; they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[24:15]</strong> Give praise to the Lord in the east, to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the sea-lands.</p>
<p><strong>[24:16]</strong> From the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs, glory to the upright. But I said, I am wasting away, wasting away, the curse is on me! The false ones go on in their false way, yes, they go on acting falsely.</p>
<p><strong>[24:17]</strong> Fear, and death, and the net, are come on you, O people of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[24:18]</strong> And it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net: for the windows on high are open, and the bases of the earth are shaking.</p>
<p><strong>[24:19]</strong> The earth is completely broken, it is parted in two, it is violently moved.</p>
<p><strong>[24:20]</strong> The earth will be moving uncertainly, like a man overcome by drink; it will be shaking like a tent; and the weight of its sin will be on it, crushing it down so that it will not get up again.</p>
<p><strong>[24:21]</strong> And in that day the Lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[24:22]</strong> And they will be got together, like prisoners in the prison-house; and after a long time they will have their punishment.</p>
<p><strong>[24:23]</strong> Then the moon will be veiled, and the sun put to shame; for the Lord of armies will be ruling in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his judges he will let his glory be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[25:1]</strong> O Lord, you are my God; I will give praise to you, I will give honour to your name; for you have done great acts of power; your purposes in the past have been made true and certain in effect.</p>
<p><strong>[25:2]</strong> For you have made a town a waste place: a strong town a mass of broken walls; the tower of the men of pride has come to an end; it will never be put up again.</p>
<p><strong>[25:3]</strong> For this cause will the strong people give glory to you, the town of the cruel ones will be in fear of you.</p>
<p><strong>[25:4]</strong> For you have been a strong place for the poor and the crushed in their trouble, a safe place from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the wrath of the cruel ones is like a winter storm.</p>
<p><strong>[25:5]</strong> As heat by the shade of a cloud, the noise of the men of pride has been made quiet by you; as heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the cruel ones has been stopped.</p>
<p><strong>[25:6]</strong> And in this mountain will the Lord of armies make for all peoples a feast of good things, a feast of wines long stored, of good things sweet to the taste, of wines long kept and tested.</p>
<p><strong>[25:7]</strong> And in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples, and the veil which is stretched over all nations.</p>
<p><strong>[25:8]</strong> He has put an end to death for ever; and the Lord God will take away all weeping; and he will put an end to the shame of his people in all the earth: for the Lord has said it.</p>
<p><strong>[25:9]</strong> And in that day it will be said, See, this is our God; we have been waiting for him, and he will be our saviour: this is the Lord in whom is our hope; we will be glad and have delight in his salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[25:10]</strong> For in this mountain will the hand of the Lord come to rest, and Moab will be crushed down in his place, even as the dry stems of the grain are crushed under foot in the waste place.</p>
<p><strong>[25:11]</strong> And if he puts out his hands, like a man stretching out his hands in swimming, the Lord will make low his pride, however expert his designs.</p>
<p><strong>[25:12]</strong> And the strong tower of your walls has been broken by him, made low, and crushed even to the dust.</p>
<p><strong>[26:1]</strong> In that day will this song be made in the land of Judah: We have a strong town; he will make salvation our walls and towers.</p>
<p><strong>[26:2]</strong> Let the doors be open, so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in.</p>
<p><strong>[26:3]</strong> The man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace, because his hope is in you.</p>
<p><strong>[26:4]</strong> Let your hope be in the Lord for ever: for the Lord Jah is an unchanging Rock.</p>
<p><strong>[26:5]</strong> For he has made low those who are lifted up, all the people of the town of pride: he makes it low, crushing it down to the earth; he makes it low in the dust.</p>
<p><strong>[26:6]</strong> It will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need.</p>
<p><strong>[26:7]</strong> The way of the good man is straight; the road of the upright is made smooth by you.</p>
<p><strong>[26:8]</strong> We have been waiting for you, O Lord; the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name.</p>
<p><strong>[26:9]</strong> In the night the desire of my soul has been for you; early will my spirit be searching for you; for when your punishments come on the earth, the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[26:10]</strong> Even if you are kind to the evil-doer, he will not go after righteousness; even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing, and will not see the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[26:11]</strong> Lord, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see: let them see &hellip; yes, your haters will be burned up in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>[26:12]</strong> Lord, you will give us peace: for all our works are the outcome of your purpose.</p>
<p><strong>[26:13]</strong> O Lord, our God, other lords than you have had rule over us; but in you only is our salvation, and no other name will we take on our lips.</p>
<p><strong>[26:14]</strong> The dead will not come back to life: their spirits will not come back to earth; for this cause you have sent destruction on them, so that the memory of them is dead.</p>
<p><strong>[26:15]</strong> You have made the nation great, O Lord, you have made it great; glory is yours: you have made wide the limits of the land.</p>
<p><strong>[26:16]</strong> Lord, in trouble our eyes have been turned to you, we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us.</p>
<p><strong>[26:17]</strong> As a woman with child, whose time is near, is troubled, crying out in her pain; so have we been before you, O Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[26:18]</strong> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have given birth to wind; no salvation has come to the earth through us, and no children have come into the world.</p>
<p><strong>[26:19]</strong> Your dead will come back; their dead bodies will come to life again. Those in the dust, awaking from their sleep, will send out a song; for your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the shades.</p>
<p><strong>[26:20]</strong> Come, my people, into your secret places, and let your doors be shut: keep yourself safe for a short time, till his wrath is over.</p>
<p><strong>[26:21]</strong> For the Lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evil-doing: the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen, and will keep her dead covered no longer.</p>
<p><strong>[27:1]</strong> In that day the Lord, with his great and strong and cruel sword, will send punishment on Leviathan, the quick-moving snake, and on Leviathan, the twisted snake; and he will put to death the dragon which is in the sea.</p>
<p><strong>[27:2]</strong> In that day it will be said, A vine-garden of delight, make a song about it.</p>
<p><strong>[27:3]</strong> I, the Lord, am watching it; I will give it water at all times: I will keep it night and day, for fear that any damage comes to it.</p>
<p><strong>[27:4]</strong> My passion is over: if the thorns were fighting against me, I would make an attack on them, and they would be burned up together.</p>
<p><strong>[27:5]</strong> Or let him put himself under my power, and make peace with me.</p>
<p><strong>[27:6]</strong> In days to come Jacob will take root: Israel will put out buds and flowers; and the face of the world will be full of fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[27:7]</strong> Is his punishment like the punishment of those who overcame him? or are his dead as great in number as those he put to the sword?</p>
<p><strong>[27:8]</strong> Your anger against her has been made clear by driving her away; he has taken her away with his storm-wind in the day of his east wind.</p>
<p><strong>[27:9]</strong> So by this will the sin of Jacob be covered, and this is all the fruit of taking away his punishment; when all the stones of the altar are crushed together, so that the wood pillars and the sun-images will not be put up again.</p>
<p><strong>[27:10]</strong> For the strong town is without men, an unpeopled living-place; and she has become a waste land: there the young ox will take his rest, and its branches will be food for him.</p>
<p><strong>[27:11]</strong> When its branches are dry they will be broken off; the women will come and put fire to them: for it is a foolish people; for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them, and he whose work they are will not have pity on them.</p>
<p><strong>[27:12]</strong> And it will be in that day that the Lord will get together his grain, from the River to the stream of Egypt, and you will be got together with care, O children of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[27:13]</strong> And it will be in that day that a great horn will be sounded; and those who were wandering in the land of Assyria, and those who had been sent away into the land of Egypt, will come; and they will give worship to the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[28:1]</strong> Ho! crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim, and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of those who are overcome by strong drink!</p>
<p><strong>[28:2]</strong> See, the Lord has a strong and cruel one; like a rain of ice, a storm of destruction, like the overflowing of a strong river, he will violently overcome them.</p>
<p><strong>[28:3]</strong> The crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim will be crushed under foot;</p>
<p><strong>[28:4]</strong> And the dead flower of his glory, which is on the head of the fertile valley, will be like the first early fruit before the summer; which a man takes and puts in his mouth the minute he sees it.</p>
<p><strong>[28:5]</strong> In that day will the Lord of armies be a crown of glory, and a fair ornament, to the rest of his people;</p>
<p><strong>[28:6]</strong> And a spirit of wisdom to the judge, and strength to those who keep back the attackers at the door of the town.</p>
<p><strong>[28:7]</strong> And further, these are uncertain through wine, and have gone out of the right way through strong drink: the priest and the prophet are uncertain through strong drink, they are overcome by wine, they have gone out of the way through strong drink; their vision is false, they go wrong in their decisions.</p>
<p><strong>[28:8]</strong> For all the tables are covered with coughed-up food, so that there is not a clean place.</p>
<p><strong>[28:9]</strong> To whom will he give knowledge? and to whom will he make clear the word? Will it be to those who have newly given up milk, and who have only now been taken from the breast?</p>
<p><strong>[28:10]</strong> For it is one rule after another; one line after another; here a little, there a little.</p>
<p><strong>[28:11]</strong> No, but with broken talk, and with a strange tongue, he will give his word to this people:</p>
<p><strong>[28:12]</strong> To whom he said, This is the rest, give rest to him who is tired; and by this you may get new strength; but they would not give ear.</p>
<p><strong>[28:13]</strong> For this cause the word of the Lord will be to them rule after rule, line after line, here a little, there a little; so that they may go on their way, and falling back may be broken, and taken in the net.</p>
<p><strong>[28:14]</strong> Give ear then to the word of the Lord, you men of pride, the rulers of this people in Jerusalem:</p>
<p><strong>[28:15]</strong> Because you have said, We have made death our friend, and with the underworld we have made an agreement; when the overflowing waters come through they will not come near us; for we are looking to false words for help, taking cover in what is untrue:</p>
<p><strong>[28:16]</strong> For this cause says the Lord God, See, I am placing in Zion as a base, a stone, a tested stone, an angle-stone which is certain and of great value: and he who has faith will not give way.</p>
<p><strong>[28:17]</strong> And I will make right decision the measuring-line, and righteousness the weight: and the ice-storm will take away the safe place of false words, and the secret place will be covered by the flowing waters.</p>
<p><strong>[28:18]</strong> And the help you were looking for from death will come to nothing, and your agreement with the underworld will be broken; when the overflowing waters come through, then you will be overcome by them.</p>
<p><strong>[28:19]</strong> Whenever they come through they will overtake you; for they will come through morning after morning, by day and by night: and the news will be nothing but fear.</p>
<p><strong>[28:20]</strong> For the bed is not long enough for a man to be stretched out on: and the cover is not wide enough for him to be covered with.</p>
<p><strong>[28:21]</strong> For the Lord will come up as on Mount Perazim, he will be moved to wrath as in the valley of Gibeon; so that he may do his work&ndash;strange is his work; and give effect to his act&ndash;unnatural is his act.</p>
<p><strong>[28:22]</strong> And now, take care that you do not make sport of him, or your bands will be made strong; for I have had word from the Lord, the Lord of armies, of an end, of a complete end, which is to come on all the land.</p>
<p><strong>[28:23]</strong> Let your ears be open to my voice; give attention to what I say.</p>
<p><strong>[28:24]</strong> Is the ploughman for ever ploughing? does he not get the earth ready and broken up for the seed?</p>
<p><strong>[28:25]</strong> When the face of the earth has been levelled, does he not put in the different sorts of seed, and the grain in lines, and the barley in its place, and the spelt at the edge?</p>
<p><strong>[28:26]</strong> For his God is his teacher, giving him the knowledge of these things.</p>
<p><strong>[28:27]</strong> For the fitches are not crushed with a sharp instrument, and a cart-wheel is not rolled over the cummin; but the grain of the fitches is hammered out with a stick, and of the cummin with a rod.</p>
<p><strong>[28:28]</strong> Is the grain for bread crushed? He does not go on crushing it for ever, but he lets his cart-wheels and his horses go over it without crushing it.</p>
<p><strong>[28:29]</strong> This comes from the Lord of armies, purposing wonders, and wise in all his acts.</p>
<p><strong>[29:1]</strong> Ho! Ariel, Ariel, the town against which David made war; put year to year, let the feasts come round:</p>
<p><strong>[29:2]</strong> And I will send trouble on Ariel, and there will be weeping and cries of grief; and she will be to me as Ariel.</p>
<p><strong>[29:3]</strong> And I will make war on you like David, and you will be shut in by earthworks, and I will make towers round you.</p>
<p><strong>[29:4]</strong> And you will be made low, and your voice will come out of the earth, and your words will be low out of the dust; and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit, making bird-like noises out of the dust.</p>
<p><strong>[29:5]</strong> And the army of your attackers will be like small dust, and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind; suddenly it will come about.</p>
<p><strong>[29:6]</strong> The Lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth-shaking and great noise, with rushing wind and storm, and the flame of burning fire.</p>
<p><strong>[29:7]</strong> And all the nations making war on Ariel, and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers, will be like a dream, like a vision of the night.</p>
<p><strong>[29:8]</strong> And it will be like a man desiring food, and dreaming that he is feasting; but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth: or like a man in need of water, dreaming that he is drinking; but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire: so will all the nations be which make war on Mount Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[29:9]</strong> Be surprised and full of wonder; let your eyes be covered and be blind: be overcome, but not with wine; go with uncertain steps, but not because of strong drink.</p>
<p><strong>[29:10]</strong> For the Lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep; and by him your eyes, the prophets, are shut, and your heads, the seers, are covered.</p>
<p><strong>[29:11]</strong> And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut, which men give to one who has knowledge of writing, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I am not able to, for the book is shut:</p>
<p><strong>[29:12]</strong> And they give it to one without learning, saying, Make clear to us what is in the book: and he says, I have no knowledge of writing.</p>
<p><strong>[29:13]</strong> And the Lord said, because this people come near to me with their mouths, and give honour to me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, and their fear of me is false, a rule given them by the teaching of men;</p>
<p><strong>[29:14]</strong> For this cause I will again do a strange thing among this people, a thing to be wondered at: and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing, and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[29:15]</strong> Cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the Lord, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and who has knowledge of our acts?</p>
<p><strong>[29:16]</strong> You are turning things upside down! Is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it? will the thing made say of him who made it, He made me not: or the thing formed say of him who gave it form, He has no knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>[29:17]</strong> In a very short time Lebanon will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will seem like a wood.</p>
<p><strong>[29:18]</strong> And in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark.</p>
<p><strong>[29:19]</strong> And the poor will have their joy in the Lord increased, and those in need will be glad in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[29:20]</strong> For the cruel one has come to nothing; and those who make sport of the Lord are gone; and those who are watching to do evil are cut off:</p>
<p><strong>[29:21]</strong> Who give help to a man in a wrong cause, and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place, taking away a man&rsquo;s right without cause.</p>
<p><strong>[29:22]</strong> For this reason the Lord, the saviour of Abraham, says about the family of Jacob, Jacob will not now be put to shame, or his face be clouded with fear.</p>
<p><strong>[29:23]</strong> But when they, the children of Jacob, see the work of my hands among them, they will give honour to my name; yes, they will give honour to the Holy One of Jacob, and go in fear of the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[29:24]</strong> Those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge, and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching.</p>
<p><strong>[30:1]</strong> Ho! uncontrolled children, says the Lord, who give effect to a purpose which is not mine, and who make an agreement, but not by my spirit, increasing their sin:</p>
<p><strong>[30:2]</strong> Who make a move to go down into Egypt, without authority from me; who are looking to the strength of Pharaoh for help, and whose hope is in the shade of Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>[30:3]</strong> And the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and your hope in the shade of Egypt will come to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[30:4]</strong> For his chiefs are at Zoan, and his representatives have come to Hanes.</p>
<p><strong>[30:5]</strong> For they have all come with offerings to a people of no use to them, in whom is no help or profit, but only shame and a bad name.</p>
<p><strong>[30:6]</strong> The word about the Beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and grief, the land of the she-lion and the voice of the lion, of the snake and the burning winged snake, they take their wealth on the backs of young asses, and their stores on camels, to a people in whom is no profit.</p>
<p><strong>[30:7]</strong> For there is no use or purpose in the help of Egypt: so I have said about her, She is Rahab, who has come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[30:8]</strong> Now go, put it in writing before them on a board, and make a record of it in a book, so that it may be for the future, a witness for all time to come.</p>
<p><strong>[30:9]</strong> For they are an uncontrolled people, false-hearted, who will not give ear to the teaching of the Lord:</p>
<p><strong>[30:10]</strong> Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Do not give us word of what is true, but say false things to give us pleasure:</p>
<p><strong>[30:11]</strong> Get out of the good way, turning from the right road; do not keep the Holy One of Israel before our minds.</p>
<p><strong>[30:12]</strong> For this cause the Holy One of Israel says, Because you will not give ear to this word, and are looking for help in ways of deceit and evil, and are putting your hope in them:</p>
<p><strong>[30:13]</strong> This sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall, causing its fall suddenly and in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>[30:14]</strong> And he will let it be broken as a potter&rsquo;s vessel is broken: it will be smashed to bits without mercy; so that there will not be a bit in which one may take fire from the fireplace, or water from the spring.</p>
<p><strong>[30:15]</strong> For the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, said, In quiet and rest is your salvation: peace and hope are your strength: but you would not have it so.</p>
<p><strong>[30:16]</strong> Saying, No, for we will go in flight on horses; so you will certainly go in flight: and, We will go on the backs of quick-running beasts; so those who go after you will be quick-footed.</p>
<p><strong>[30:17]</strong> A thousand will go in fear before one; even before five you will go in flight: till you are like a pillar by itself on the top of a mountain, and like a flag on a hill.</p>
<p><strong>[30:18]</strong> For this cause the Lord will be waiting, so that he may be kind to you; and he will be lifted up, so that he may have mercy on you; for the Lord is a God of righteousness: there is a blessing on all whose hope is in him.</p>
<p><strong>[30:19]</strong> O people, living in Zion, at Jerusalem, your weeping will be ended; he will certainly have mercy on you at the sound of your cry; when it comes to his ear, he will give you an answer.</p>
<p><strong>[30:20]</strong> And though the Lord will give you the bread of trouble and the water of grief, you will no longer put your teacher on one side, but you will see your teacher:</p>
<p><strong>[30:21]</strong> And at your back, when you are turning to the right hand or to the left, a voice will be sounding in your ears, saying, This is the way in which you are to go.</p>
<p><strong>[30:22]</strong> And you will make unclean what is covering your pictured images of silver, and the plating of your images of gold: you will send them away as an unclean thing, saying, Be gone!</p>
<p><strong>[30:23]</strong> And he will give rain for your seed, so that you may put it in the earth; and you will have bread from the produce of the earth, good and more than enough for your needs: in that day the cattle will get their food in wide grass-lands.</p>
<p><strong>[30:24]</strong> And the oxen and the young asses which are used for ploughing, will have salted grain which has been made free from the waste with fork and basket.</p>
<p><strong>[30:25]</strong> And there will be rivers and streams of water on every tall mountain and on every high hill, in the day when great numbers are put to the sword, when the towers come down.</p>
<p><strong>[30:26]</strong> And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times greater, as the light of seven days, in the day when the Lord puts oil on the wounds of his people, and makes them well from the blows they have undergone.</p>
<p><strong>[30:27]</strong> See, the name of the Lord is coming from far, burning with his wrath, with thick smoke going up: his lips are full of passion, and his tongue is like a burning fire:</p>
<p><strong>[30:28]</strong> And his breath is as an overflowing stream, coming up even to the neck, shaking the nations for their destruction, like the shaking of grain in a basket: and he will put a cord in the mouths of the people, turning them out of their way.</p>
<p><strong>[30:29]</strong> You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and you will be glad in heart, as when they go with music of the pipe to the mountain of the Lord, the Rock of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[30:30]</strong> And the Lord will send out the sound of his great voice, and they will see his arm stretched out, with the heat of his wrath, and the flame of a burning fire; with a cloud-burst, and storm, and a rain of ice.</p>
<p><strong>[30:31]</strong> For through the voice of the Lord the Assyrian will be broken, and the Lord&rsquo;s rod will be lifted up against him.</p>
<p><strong>[30:32]</strong> And every blow of the rod of his punishment, which the Lord will send on him, will be with the sound of music: and with the waving of his sword the Lord will make war against him.</p>
<p><strong>[30:33]</strong> For a place of fire has long been ready; yes, it has been made ready for the king; he has made it deep and wide: it is massed with fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of fire, puts a light to it.</p>
<p><strong>[31:1]</strong> Cursed are those who go down to Egypt for help, and who put their faith in horses; looking to war-carriages for salvation, because of their numbers; and to horsemen, because they are very strong; but they are not looking to the Holy One of Israel, or turning their hearts to the Lord;</p>
<p><strong>[31:2]</strong> Though he is wise, and able to send evil, and his purpose will not be changed; but he will go against the house of the evil-doers, and against those to whom they are looking for help.</p>
<p><strong>[31:3]</strong> For the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit: and when the Lord&rsquo;s hand is stretched out, the helper and he who is helped will come down together.</p>
<p><strong>[31:4]</strong> For the Lord has said to me, As a lion, or a young lion, makes an angry noise over his food, and if a band of herdsmen come out against him, he will not be in fear of their voices, or give up his food for their noise: so the Lord of armies will come down to make war against Mount Zion and its hill.</p>
<p><strong>[31:5]</strong> Like birds with outstretched wings, so will the Lord of armies be a cover to Jerusalem; he will be a cover and salvation for it, going over it he will keep it from danger.</p>
<p><strong>[31:6]</strong> Come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[31:7]</strong> For in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold, the sin which they made for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>[31:8]</strong> Then the Assyrian will come down by the sword, but not of man; the sword, not of men, will be the cause of his destruction: and he will go in flight from the sword, and his young men will be put to forced work.</p>
<p><strong>[31:9]</strong> And his rock will come to nothing because of fear, and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag, says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and his altar in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[32:1]</strong> See, a king will be ruling in righteousness, and chiefs will give right decisions.</p>
<p><strong>[32:2]</strong> And a man will be as a safe place from the wind, and a cover from the storm; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a waste land.</p>
<p><strong>[32:3]</strong> And the eyes of those who see will not be shut, and those who have hearing will give ear to the word.</p>
<p><strong>[32:4]</strong> The man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart, and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly.</p>
<p><strong>[32:5]</strong> The foolish man will no longer be named noble, and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour.</p>
<p><strong>[32:6]</strong> For the foolish man will say foolish things, having evil thoughts in his heart, working what is unclean, and talking falsely about the Lord, to keep food from him who is in need of it, and water from him whose soul is desiring it.</p>
<p><strong>[32:7]</strong> The designs of the false are evil, purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words, even when he is in the right.</p>
<p><strong>[32:8]</strong> But the noble-hearted man has noble purposes, and by these he will be guided.</p>
<p><strong>[32:9]</strong> Give ear to my voice, you women who are living in comfort; give attention to my words, you daughters who have no fear of danger.</p>
<p><strong>[32:10]</strong> In not much more than a year, you, who are not looking for evil, will be troubled: for the produce of the vine-gardens will be cut off, and there will be no getting in of the grapes.</p>
<p><strong>[32:11]</strong> Be shaking with fear, you women who are living in comfort; be troubled, you who have no fear of danger: take off your robes and put on clothing of grief.</p>
<p><strong>[32:12]</strong> Have sorrow for the fields, the pleasing fields, the fertile vine;</p>
<p><strong>[32:13]</strong> And for the land of my people, where thorns will come up; even for all the houses of joy in the glad town.</p>
<p><strong>[32:14]</strong> For the fair houses will have no man living in them; the town which was full of noise will become a waste; the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever, a joy for the asses of the woods, a place of food for the flocks;</p>
<p><strong>[32:15]</strong> Till the spirit comes on us from on high, and the waste land becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is changed into a wood.</p>
<p><strong>[32:16]</strong> Then in the waste land there will be an upright rule, and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field.</p>
<p><strong>[32:17]</strong> And the work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[32:18]</strong> And my people will be living in peace, in houses where there is no fear, and in quiet resting-places.</p>
<p><strong>[32:19]</strong> But the tall trees will come down with a great fall, and the town will be low in a low place.</p>
<p><strong>[32:20]</strong> Happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters, and sending out the ox and the ass.</p>
<p><strong>[33:1]</strong> Ho! you who make waste those who did not make you waste; acting falsely to those who were not false to you. When you have come to an end of wasting, you will be made waste, and after your false acts, they will do the same to you.</p>
<p><strong>[33:2]</strong> O Lord, have mercy on us; for we have been waiting for your help: be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>[33:3]</strong> At the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight; at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>[33:4]</strong> And the goods taken in war will be got together like the massing of young locusts; men will be rushing on them like the rushing of locusts.</p>
<p><strong>[33:5]</strong> The Lord is lifted up; his place is on high: he has made Zion full of righteousness and true religion.</p>
<p><strong>[33:6]</strong> And she will have no more fear of change, being full of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is her wealth.</p>
<p><strong>[33:7]</strong> See, the men of war are sorrowing outside the town: those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly.</p>
<p><strong>[33:8]</strong> The highways are waste, no man is journeying there: the agreement is broken, he has made sport of the towns, he has no thought for man.</p>
<p><strong>[33:9]</strong> The earth is sorrowing and wasting away; Lebanon is put to shame and has become waste; Sharon is like the Arabah; and in Bashan and Carmel the leaves are falling.</p>
<p><strong>[33:10]</strong> Now will I come forward, says the Lord; now will I be lifted up; now will my power be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[33:11]</strong> Your designs will be without profit, and their effect will be nothing: you will be burned up by the fire of my breath.</p>
<p><strong>[33:12]</strong> And the peoples will be like the burning of chalk: as thorns cut down, which are burned in the fire.</p>
<p><strong>[33:13]</strong> Give ear, you who are far off, to what I have done: see my power, you who are near.</p>
<p><strong>[33:14]</strong> The sinners in Zion are full of fear; the haters of God are shaking with wonder. Who among us may keep his place before the burning fire? who among us may see the eternal burnings?</p>
<p><strong>[33:15]</strong> He whose ways are true, and whose words are upright; he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts, whose hands have not taken rewards, who will have no part in putting men to death, and whose eyes are shut against evil;</p>
<p><strong>[33:16]</strong> He will have a place on high: he will be safely shut in by the high rocks: his bread will be given to him; his waters will be certain.</p>
<p><strong>[33:17]</strong> Your eyes will see the king in his glory: they will be looking on a far-stretching land.</p>
<p><strong>[33:18]</strong> Your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear: where is the scribe, where is he who made a record of the payments, where is he by whom the towers were numbered?</p>
<p><strong>[33:19]</strong> Never again will you see the cruel people, a people whose tongue has no sense for you; whose language is strange to you.</p>
<p><strong>[33:20]</strong> Let your eyes be resting on Zion, the town of our holy feasts: you will see Jerusalem, a quiet resting-place, a tent which will not be moved, whose tent-pins will never be pulled up, and whose cords will never be broken.</p>
<p><strong>[33:21]</strong> But there the Lord will be with us in his glory, &hellip; wide rivers and streams; where no boat will go with blades, and no fair ship will be sailing.</p>
<p><strong>[33:22]</strong> For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king; he will be our saviour.</p>
<p><strong>[33:23]</strong> Your cords have become loose; they were not able to make strong the support of their sails, the sail was not stretched out: then the blind will take much property, the feeble-footed will make division of the goods of war.</p>
<p><strong>[33:24]</strong> And the men of Zion will not say, I am ill: for its people will have forgiveness for their sin.</p>
<p><strong>[34:1]</strong> Come near, you nations, and give ear; take note, you peoples: let the earth and everything in it give ear; the world and all those living in it.</p>
<p><strong>[34:2]</strong> For the Lord is angry with all the nations, and his wrath is burning against all their armies: he has put them to the curse, he has given them to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[34:3]</strong> Their dead bodies will be thick on the face of the earth, and their smell will come up, and the mountains will be flowing with their blood, and all the hills will come to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>[34:4]</strong> And the heavens will be rolled together like the roll of a book: and all their army will be gone, like a dead leaf from the vine, or a dry fruit from the fig-tree.</p>
<p><strong>[34:5]</strong> For my sword in heaven is full of wrath: see, it is coming down on Edom, in punishment on the people of my curse.</p>
<p><strong>[34:6]</strong> The sword of the Lord is full of blood, it is fat with the best of the meat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the best parts of the sheep: for the Lord has a feast in Bozrah, and much cattle will be put to death in the land of Edom.</p>
<p><strong>[34:7]</strong> And the strong oxen will go down to death together with the smaller cattle.</p>
<p><strong>[34:8]</strong> For it is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s punishment, when he gives payment for the wrongs done to Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[34:9]</strong> And its streams will be turned into boiling oil, and its dust into burning stone, and all the land will be on fire.</p>
<p><strong>[34:10]</strong> It will not be put out day or night; its smoke will go up for ever: it will be waste from generation to generation; no one will go through it for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[34:11]</strong> But the birds of the waste land will have their place there; it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven: and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land.</p>
<p><strong>[34:12]</strong> The jackals will be there, and her great ones will be gone; they will say, There is no longer a kingdom there, and all her chiefs will have come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[34:13]</strong> And thorns will come up in her fair houses, and waste plants in her strong towers: and foxes will make their holes there, and it will be a meeting-place for ostriches.</p>
<p><strong>[34:14]</strong> And the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals, and the evil spirits will be crying to one another, even the night-spirit will come and make her resting-place there.</p>
<p><strong>[34:15]</strong> The arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there, and get her young together under her shade: there the hawks will come together by twos.</p>
<p><strong>[34:16]</strong> See what is recorded in the book of the Lord: all these will be there, not one without the other: the mouth of the Lord has given the order, and his spirit has made them come together.</p>
<p><strong>[34:17]</strong> And he has given them their heritage, and by his hand it has been measured out to them: it will be theirs for ever, their resting-place from generation to generation.</p>
<p><strong>[35:1]</strong> The waste land and the dry places will be glad; the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>[35:2]</strong> It will be flowering like the rose; it will be full of delight and songs; the glory of Lebanon will be given to it; the pride of Carmel and Sharon: they will see the glory of the Lord, the power of our God.</p>
<p><strong>[35:3]</strong> Make strong the feeble hands, give support to the shaking knees.</p>
<p><strong>[35:4]</strong> Say to those who are full of fear, Be strong and take heart: see, your God will give punishment; the reward of God will come; he himself will come to be your saviour.</p>
<p><strong>[35:5]</strong> Then the eyes of the blind will see, and the ears which are stopped will be open.</p>
<p><strong>[35:6]</strong> Then will the feeble-footed be jumping like a roe, and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song: for in the waste land streams will be bursting out, and waters in the dry places.</p>
<p><strong>[35:7]</strong> And the burning sand will become a pool, and the dry earth springs of waters: the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land, and water-plants will take the place of grass.</p>
<p><strong>[35:8]</strong> And a highway will be there; its name will be, The Holy Way; the unclean and the sinner may not go over it, and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish.</p>
<p><strong>[35:9]</strong> No lion will be there, or any cruel beast; they will not be seen there; but those for whom the Lord has given a price,</p>
<p><strong>[35:10]</strong> Even those whom he has made free, will come back again; they will come with songs to Zion; on their heads will be eternal joy; delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[36:1]</strong> And it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them.</p>
<p><strong>[36:2]</strong> And the king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a strong force, and he took up his position by the stream of the higher pool, by the highway of the washerman&rsquo;s</p>
<p><strong>[36:3]</strong> And there came out to him Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p>
<p><strong>[36:4]</strong> And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, These are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: In what are you placing your hope?</p>
<p><strong>[36:5]</strong> You say you have a design and strength for war, but these are only words: now to whom are you looking for support, that you have gone against my authority?</p>
<p><strong>[36:6]</strong> See, you are basing your hope on that broken rod of Egypt, which will go into a man&rsquo;s hand if he makes use of it for a support; for so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who put their faith in him.</p>
<p><strong>[36:7]</strong> And if you say to me, Our hope is in the Lord our God; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and Jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar?</p>
<p><strong>[36:8]</strong> And now, take a chance with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to put horsemen on them.</p>
<p><strong>[36:9]</strong> How then may you put to shame the least of my master&rsquo;s servants? and you have put your hope in Egypt for war-carriages and horsemen:</p>
<p><strong>[36:10]</strong> And have I now come to send destruction on this land without the Lord&rsquo;s authority? It was the Lord himself who said to me, Go up against this land and make it waste.</p>
<p><strong>[36:11]</strong> Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, Please make use of the Aramaean language in talking to your servants, for we are used to it, and do not make use of the Jews&rsquo; language in the hearing of the people on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>[36:12]</strong> But the Rab-shakeh said, Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall? for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in.</p>
<p><strong>[36:13]</strong> Then the Rab-shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the Jews&rsquo; language, Give ear to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:</p>
<p><strong>[36:14]</strong> This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.</p>
<p><strong>[36:15]</strong> And do not let Hezekiah make you put your faith in the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly keep us safe, and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[36:16]</strong> Do not give ear to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says, Make peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig-tree, and the water of his spring;</p>
<p><strong>[36:17]</strong> Till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vine-gardens.</p>
<p><strong>[36:18]</strong> Give no attention to Hezekiah when he says to you, The Lord will keep us safe. Has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p><strong>[36:19]</strong> Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? where are the gods of Samaria? and have they kept Samaria out of my hand?</p>
<p><strong>[36:20]</strong> Who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand, to give cause for the thought that the Lord will keep Jerusalem from falling into my hand?</p>
<p><strong>[36:21]</strong> But they kept quiet and gave him no answer: for the king&rsquo;s order was, Give him no answer.</p>
<p><strong>[36:22]</strong> Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief, and gave him an account of what the Rab-shakeh had said.</p>
<p><strong>[37:1]</strong> And on hearing it Hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[37:2]</strong> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the chief priests, dressed in haircloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.</p>
<p><strong>[37:3]</strong> And they said to him, Hezekiah says, This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame: for the children are ready to come to birth, but there is no strength to give birth to them.</p>
<p><strong>[37:4]</strong> It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to say evil things against the living God, and will make his words come to nothing: so make your prayer for the rest of the people.</p>
<p><strong>[37:5]</strong> So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>
<p><strong>[37:6]</strong> And Isaiah said to them, This is what you are to say to your master: The Lord says, Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing.</p>
<p><strong>[37:7]</strong> See, I will put a spirit into him, and bad news will come to his ears, and he will go back to his land; and there I will have him put to death.</p>
<p><strong>[37:8]</strong> So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah: for it had come to his ears that the king of Assyria had gone away from Lachish.</p>
<p><strong>[37:9]</strong> And when news came to him that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had made an attack on him, &hellip; And he sent representatives to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[37:10]</strong> This is what you are to say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom is your faith, give you a false hope, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p><strong>[37:11]</strong> No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse: and will you be kept safe from their fate?</p>
<p><strong>[37:12]</strong> Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?</p>
<p><strong>[37:13]</strong> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the town of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivva?</p>
<p><strong>[37:14]</strong> And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it; and after reading it, Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, opening the letter there before the Lord,</p>
<p><strong>[37:15]</strong> And he made prayer to the Lord, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[37:16]</strong> O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, seated between the winged ones, you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</p>
<p><strong>[37:17]</strong> Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord; let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see: take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God.</p>
<p><strong>[37:18]</strong> Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands,</p>
<p><strong>[37:19]</strong> And have given their gods to the fire: for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men&rsquo;s hands; so they have given them to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[37:20]</strong> But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hand, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you, and you only, are the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[37:21]</strong> Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears.</p>
<p><strong>[37:22]</strong> This is the word which the Lord has said about him: In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at; the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you.</p>
<p><strong>[37:23]</strong> Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[37:24]</strong> You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord, and have said, With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains, to the inmost parts of Lebanon; and its tall cedars will be cut down, and the best trees of its woods: I will come up into his highest places, into his thick woods.</p>
<p><strong>[37:25]</strong> I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry.</p>
<p><strong>[37:26]</strong> Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.</p>
<p><strong>[37:27]</strong> This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field, or a green plant; like the grass on the house-tops, which a cold wind makes waste.</p>
<p><strong>[37:28]</strong> But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in.</p>
<p><strong>[37:29]</strong> Because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came.</p>
<p><strong>[37:30]</strong> And this will be the sign to you: you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself, and in the second year from the produce of the same; and in the third year you will put in your seed, and get in the grain, and make vine-gardens, and take of their fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[37:31]</strong> And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth, and give fruit.</p>
<p><strong>[37:32]</strong> For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done.</p>
<p><strong>[37:33]</strong> For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it.</p>
<p><strong>[37:34]</strong> By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town.</p>
<p><strong>[37:35]</strong> For I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David.</p>
<p><strong>[37:36]</strong> And the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men: and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies.</p>
<p><strong>[37:37]</strong> Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went back to his place at Nineveh.</p>
<p><strong>[37:38]</strong> And it came about, when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword, and they went in flight into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon, his son, became king in his place.</p>
<p><strong>[38:1]</strong> In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, The Lord says, Put your house in order; for your death is near.</p>
<p><strong>[38:2]</strong> And Hezekiah, turning his face to the wall, made his prayer to the Lord, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[38:3]</strong> O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.</p>
<p><strong>[38:4]</strong> Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,</p>
<p><strong>[38:5]</strong> Go to Hezekiah, and say, The Lord, the God of David, your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping: see, I will give you fifteen more years of life.</p>
<p><strong>[38:6]</strong> And I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria: and I will keep watch over this town.</p>
<p><strong>[38:7]</strong> And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said:</p>
<p><strong>[38:8]</strong> See, I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, go back ten steps. So the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down.</p>
<p><strong>[38:9]</strong> The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after he had been ill, and had got better from his disease.</p>
<p><strong>[38:10]</strong> I said, In the quiet of my days I am going down into the underworld: the rest of my years are being taken away from me.</p>
<p><strong>[38:11]</strong> I said, I will not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living: I will not see man again or those living in the world.</p>
<p><strong>[38:12]</strong> My resting-place is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsman&rsquo;s tent: my life is rolled up like a linen-worker&rsquo;s thread; I am cut off from the cloth on the frame: from day even to night you give me up to pain.</p>
<p><strong>[38:13]</strong> I am crying out with pain till the morning; it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones.</p>
<p><strong>[38:14]</strong> I make cries like a bird; I give out sounds of grief like a dove: my eyes are looking up with desire; O Lord, I am crushed, take up my cause.</p>
<p><strong>[38:15]</strong> What am I to say? seeing that it is he who has done it: all my time of sleeping I am turning from side to side without rest.</p>
<p><strong>[38:16]</strong> O Lord, for this cause I am waiting for you, give rest to my spirit: make me well again, and let me come back to life.</p>
<p><strong>[38:17]</strong> See, in place of peace my soul had bitter sorrow. but you have kept back my soul from the underworld; for you have put all my sins out of your memory.</p>
<p><strong>[38:18]</strong> For the underworld is not able to give you praise, death gives you no honour: for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy.</p>
<p><strong>[38:19]</strong> The living, the living man, he will give you praise, as I do this day: the father will give the story of your mercy to his children.</p>
<p><strong>[38:20]</strong> O Lord, quickly be my saviour; so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[38:21]</strong> And Isaiah said, Let them take a cake of figs, and put it on the diseased place, and he will get well.</p>
<p><strong>[38:22]</strong> And Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord?</p>
<p><strong>[39:1]</strong> At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters with an offering to Hezekiah, because he had news that Hezekiah had been ill, and was well again.</p>
<p><strong>[39:2]</strong> And Hezekiah was glad at their coming, and let them see all his store of wealth, the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil, and all the house of his arms, and everything there was in his stores: there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which he did not let them see.</p>
<p><strong>[39:3]</strong> Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and where did they come from? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, even from Babylon.</p>
<p><strong>[39:4]</strong> And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said in answer, They saw everything in my house: there is nothing among my stores which I did not let them see.</p>
<p><strong>[39:5]</strong> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Give ear to the word of the Lord of armies:</p>
<p><strong>[39:6]</strong> Truly, the days are coming when everything in your house, and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day, will be taken away to Babylon: all will be gone.</p>
<p><strong>[39:7]</strong> And your sons, even your offspring, will they take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p><strong>[39:8]</strong> Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which you have said. And he said in his heart, There will be peace and quiet in my days.</p>
<p><strong>[40:1]</strong> Give comfort, give comfort, to my people, says your God.</p>
<p><strong>[40:2]</strong> Say kind words to the heart of Jerusalem, crying out to her that her time of trouble is ended, that her punishment is complete; that she has been rewarded by the Lord&rsquo;s hand twice over for all her sins.</p>
<p><strong>[40:3]</strong> A voice of one crying, Make ready in the waste land the way of the Lord, make level in the lowland a highway for our God.</p>
<p><strong>[40:4]</strong> Let every valley be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low, and let the rough places become level, and the hilltops become a valley,</p>
<p><strong>[40:5]</strong> And the glory of the Lord will be made clear, and all flesh will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has said it.</p>
<p><strong>[40:6]</strong> A voice of one saying, Give a cry! And I said, What is my cry to be? All flesh is grass, and all its strength like the flower of the field.</p>
<p><strong>[40:7]</strong> The grass becomes dry, the flower is dead; because the breath of the Lord goes over it: truly the people is grass.</p>
<p><strong>[40:8]</strong> The grass is dry, the flower is dead; but the word of our God is eternal.</p>
<p><strong>[40:9]</strong> You who give good news to Zion, get up into the high mountain; you who give good news to Jerusalem, let your voice be strong; let it be sounding without fear; say to the towns of Judah, See, your God!</p>
<p><strong>[40:10]</strong> See, the Lord God will come as a strong one, ruling in power: see, those made free by him are with him, and those whom he has made safe go before him.</p>
<p><strong>[40:11]</strong> He will give food to his flock like a keeper of sheep; with his arm he will get it together, and will take up the lambs on his breast, gently guiding those which are with young.</p>
<p><strong>[40:12]</strong> In the hollow of whose hand have the waters been measured? and who is able to take the heavens in his stretched-out fingers? who has got together the dust of the earth in a measure? who has taken the weight of the mountains, or put the hills into the scales?</p>
<p><strong>[40:13]</strong> By whom has the spirit of the Lord been guided, or who has been his teacher?</p>
<p><strong>[40:14]</strong> Who gave him suggestions, and made clear to him the right way? who gave him knowledge, guiding him in the way of wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>[40:15]</strong> See, the nations are to him like a drop hanging from a bucket, and like the small dust in the scales: he takes up the islands like small dust.</p>
<p><strong>[40:16]</strong> And Lebanon is not enough to make a fire with, or all its cattle enough for a burned offering.</p>
<p><strong>[40:17]</strong> All the nations are as nothing before him; even less than nothing, a thing of no value.</p>
<p><strong>[40:18]</strong> Whom then is God like, in your opinion? or what will you put forward as a comparison with him?</p>
<p><strong>[40:19]</strong> The workman makes an image, and the gold-worker puts gold plates over it, and makes silver bands for it.</p>
<p><strong>[40:20]</strong> The wise workman makes selection of the mulberry-tree of the offering, a wood which will not become soft; so that the image may be fixed to it and not be moved.</p>
<p><strong>[40:21]</strong> Have you no knowledge of it? has it not come to your ears? has not news of it been given to you from the first? has it not been clear to you from the time when the earth was placed on its base?</p>
<p><strong>[40:22]</strong> It is he who is seated over the arch of the earth, and the people in it are as small as locusts; by him the heavens are stretched out like an arch, and made ready like a tent for a living-place.</p>
<p><strong>[40:23]</strong> He makes rulers come to nothing; the judges of the earth are of no value.</p>
<p><strong>[40:24]</strong> They have only now been planted, and their seed put into the earth, and they have only now taken root, when he sends out his breath over them and they become dry, and the storm-wind takes them away like dry grass.</p>
<p><strong>[40:25]</strong> Who then seems to you to be my equal? says the Holy One.</p>
<p><strong>[40:26]</strong> Let your eyes be lifted up on high, and see: who has made these? He who sends out their numbered army: who has knowledge of all their names: by whose great strength, because he is strong in power, all of them are in their places.</p>
<p><strong>[40:27]</strong> Why do you say, O Jacob, such words as these, O Israel, The Lord&rsquo;s eyes are not on my way, and my God gives no attention to my cause?</p>
<p><strong>[40:28]</strong> Have you no knowledge of it? has it not come to your ears? The eternal God, the Lord, the Maker of the ends of the earth, is never feeble or tired; there is no searching out of his wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>[40:29]</strong> He gives power to the feeble, increasing the strength of him who has no force.</p>
<p><strong>[40:30]</strong> Even the young men will become feeble and tired, and the best of them will come to the end of his strength;</p>
<p><strong>[40:31]</strong> But those who are waiting for the Lord will have new strength; they will get wings like eagles: running, they will not be tired, and walking, they will have no weariness.</p>
<p><strong>[41:1]</strong> Come quietly before me, O sea-lands, and let the peoples get together their strength: let them come near; then let them say what they have to say: let us put forward our cause against one another.</p>
<p><strong>[41:2]</strong> Who sent out from the east one who is right wherever he goes? he gives the nations into his hands, and makes him ruler over kings; he gives them as the dust to his sword, as dry stems before the wind to his bow.</p>
<p><strong>[41:3]</strong> He goes after them safely, not touching the road with his feet.</p>
<p><strong>[41:4]</strong> Whose purpose and work was it? His who sent out the generations from the start. I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am he.</p>
<p><strong>[41:5]</strong> The sea-lands saw it, and were in fear; the ends of the earth were shaking: they came near.</p>
<p><strong>[41:6]</strong> They gave help everyone to his neighbour; and everyone said to his brother, Take heart!</p>
<p><strong>[41:7]</strong> So the metal-worker put heart into the gold-worker, and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron-worker, saying of the plate, It is ready: and he put it together with nails, so that there might be no slipping.</p>
<p><strong>[41:8]</strong> But as for you, Israel, my servant, and you, Jacob, whom I have taken for myself, the seed of Abraham my friend:</p>
<p><strong>[41:9]</strong> You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and sent for from its farthest parts, saying to you, You are my servant, whom I have taken for myself, and whom I have not given up:</p>
<p><strong>[41:10]</strong> Have no fear, for I am with you; do not be looking about in trouble, for I am your God; I will give you strength, yes, I will be your helper; yes, my true right hand will be your support.</p>
<p><strong>[41:11]</strong> Truly, all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame: those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[41:12]</strong> You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[41:13]</strong> For I, the Lord your God, have taken your right hand in mine, saying to you, Have no fear; I will be your helper.</p>
<p><strong>[41:14]</strong> Have no fear, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will be your helper, says the Lord, even he who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[41:15]</strong> See, I will make you like a new grain-crushing instrument with teeth, crushing the mountains small, and making the hills like dry stems.</p>
<p><strong>[41:16]</strong> You will send the wind over them, and it will take them away; they will go in all directions before the storm-wind: you will have joy in the Lord, and be glad in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[41:17]</strong> The poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is, and their tongue is dry for need of it: I the Lord will give ear to their prayer, I the God of Israel will not give them up.</p>
<p><strong>[41:18]</strong> I will make rivers on the dry mountain-tops, and fountains in the valleys: I will make the waste land a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</p>
<p><strong>[41:19]</strong> I will put in the waste land the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive-tree; and in the lowland will be planted the fir-tree, the plane, and the cypress together:</p>
<p><strong>[41:20]</strong> So that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it, and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the Lord has done this, and that the Holy One of Israel has made it.</p>
<p><strong>[41:21]</strong> Put forward your cause, says the Lord; let your strong argument come out, says the King of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[41:22]</strong> Let the future be made clear to us: give us news of the past things, so that we may give thought to them; or of the things to come, so that we may see if they are true.</p>
<p><strong>[41:23]</strong> Give us word of what will be after this, so that we may be certain that you are gods: yes, do good or do evil, so that we may all see it and be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>[41:24]</strong> But you are nothing, and your work is of no value: foolish is he who takes you for his gods.</p>
<p><strong>[41:25]</strong> I have sent for one from the north, and from the dawn he has come; in my name he will get rulers together and go against them; they will be like dust, even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter.</p>
<p><strong>[41:26]</strong> Who has given knowledge of it from the first, so that we may be certain of it? and from the start, so that we may say, His word is true? There is no one who gives news, or says anything, or who gives ear to your words.</p>
<p><strong>[41:27]</strong> I was the first to give word of it to Zion, and I gave the good news to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[41:28]</strong> And I saw that there was no man, even no wise man among them, who might give an answer to my questions.</p>
<p><strong>[41:29]</strong> Truly they are all nothing, their works are nothing and of no value: their metal images are of no more use than wind.</p>
<p><strong>[42:1]</strong> See my servant, whom I am supporting, my loved one, in whom I take delight: I have put my spirit on him; he will give the knowledge of the true God to the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[42:2]</strong> He will make no cry, his voice will not be loud: his words will not come to men&rsquo;s ears in the streets.</p>
<p><strong>[42:3]</strong> He will not let a crushed stem be quite broken, and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out: he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples.</p>
<p><strong>[42:4]</strong> His light will not be put out, and he will not be crushed, till he has given the knowledge of the true God to the earth, and the sea-lands will be waiting for his teaching.</p>
<p><strong>[42:5]</strong> God the Lord, even he who made the heavens, measuring them out on high; stretching out the earth, and giving its produce; he who gives breath to the people on it, and life to those who go about on it, says:</p>
<p><strong>[42:6]</strong> I the Lord have made you the vessel of my purpose, I have taken you by the hand, and kept you safe, and I have given you to be an agreement to the people, and a light to the nations:</p>
<p><strong>[42:7]</strong> To give eyes to the blind, to make free the prisoners from the prison, to let out those who are shut up in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>[42:8]</strong> I am the Lord; that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, or my praise to pictured images.</p>
<p><strong>[42:9]</strong> See, the things said before have come about, and now I give word of new things: before they come I give you news of them.</p>
<p><strong>[42:10]</strong> Make a new song to the Lord, and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and everything in it, the sea-lands and their people.</p>
<p><strong>[42:11]</strong> Let the waste land and its flocks be glad, the tent-circles of Kedar; let the people of the rock give a glad cry, from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy.</p>
<p><strong>[42:12]</strong> Let them give glory to the Lord, sounding his praise in the sea-lands.</p>
<p><strong>[42:13]</strong> The Lord will go out as a man of war, he will be moved to wrath like a fighting-man: his voice will be strong, he will give a loud cry; he will go against his attackers like a man of war.</p>
<p><strong>[42:14]</strong> I have long been quiet, I have kept myself in and done nothing: now I will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth, breathing hard and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>[42:15]</strong> I will make waste mountains and hills, drying up all their plants; and I will make rivers dry, and pools dry land.</p>
<p><strong>[42:16]</strong> And I will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge, guiding them by roads strange to them: I will make the dark places light before them, and the rough places level. These things will I do and will not give them up.</p>
<p><strong>[42:17]</strong> They will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images, who say to metal images, You are our gods.</p>
<p><strong>[42:18]</strong> Give ear, you whose ears are shut; and let your eyes be open, you blind, so that you may see.</p>
<p><strong>[42:19]</strong> Who is blind, but my servant? who has his ears stopped, but he whom I send? who is blind as my true one, or who has his ears shut like the Lord&rsquo;s servant?</p>
<p><strong>[42:20]</strong> Seeing much, but keeping nothing in mind; his ears are open, but there is no hearing.</p>
<p><strong>[42:21]</strong> It was the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure, because of his righteousness, to make the teaching great and give it honour.</p>
<p><strong>[42:22]</strong> But this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force; they are all taken in holes, and shut up in prisons: they are made prisoners, and no one makes them free; they are taken by force and no one says, Give them back.</p>
<p><strong>[42:23]</strong> Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will give attention to it for the time to come?</p>
<p><strong>[42:24]</strong> Who gave up Jacob to those who took away his goods, and Israel to his attackers? Did not the Lord? he against whom they did wrong, and in whose ways they would not go, turning away from his teaching.</p>
<p><strong>[42:25]</strong> For this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath, and his strength was like a flame; and it put fire round about him, but he did not see it; he was burned, but did not take it to heart.</p>
<p><strong>[43:1]</strong> But now, says the Lord your Maker, O Jacob, and your life-giver, O Israel: have no fear, for I have taken up your cause; naming you by your name, I have made you mine.</p>
<p><strong>[43:2]</strong> When you go through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not go over you: when you go through the fire, you will not be burned; and the flame will have no power over you.</p>
<p><strong>[43:3]</strong> For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your saviour; I have given Egypt as a price for you, Ethiopia and Seba for you.</p>
<p><strong>[43:4]</strong> Because of your value in my eyes, you have been honoured, and loved by me; so I will give men for you, and peoples for your life.</p>
<p><strong>[43:5]</strong> Have no fear, for I am with you: I will take your seed from the east, and get you together from the west;</p>
<p><strong>[43:6]</strong> I will say to the north, Give them up; and to the south, Do not keep them back; send back my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;</p>
<p><strong>[43:7]</strong> Every one who is named by my name, and whom I have made for my glory, who has been formed and designed by me.</p>
<p><strong>[43:8]</strong> Send out the blind people who have eyes, and those who have ears, but they are shut.</p>
<p><strong>[43:9]</strong> Let all the nations come together, and let the peoples be present: who among them is able to make this clear, and give us word of earlier things? let their witnesses come forward, so that they may be seen to be true, and that they may give ear, and say, It is true.</p>
<p><strong>[43:10]</strong> You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and my servant whom I have taken for myself: so that you may see and have faith in me, and that it may be clear to you that I am he; before me there was no God formed, and there will not be after me.</p>
<p><strong>[43:11]</strong> I, even I, am the Lord; and there is no saviour but me.</p>
<p><strong>[43:12]</strong> I gave the word, and made it clear, and there was no strange god among you: for this reason you are my witnesses, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[43:13]</strong> From time long past I am God, and from this day I am he: there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand: when I undertake a thing, by whom will my purpose be changed?</p>
<p><strong>[43:14]</strong> The Lord, who has taken up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, Because of you I have sent to Babylon, and made all their seers come south, and the Chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships.</p>
<p><strong>[43:15]</strong> I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Maker of Israel, your King.</p>
<p><strong>[43:16]</strong> This is the word of the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a road through the deep waters;</p>
<p><strong>[43:17]</strong> Who sends out the war-carriages and the horses, the army with all its force; they have come down, they will not get up again; like a feebly burning light they are put out.</p>
<p><strong>[43:18]</strong> Give no thought to the things which are past; let the early times go out of your minds.</p>
<p><strong>[43:19]</strong> See, I am doing a new thing; now it is starting; will you not take note of it? I will even make a way in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country.</p>
<p><strong>[43:20]</strong> The beasts of the field will give me honour, the jackals and the ostriches: because I send out waters in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country, to give drink to the people whom I have taken for myself:</p>
<p><strong>[43:21]</strong> Even the people whom I made to be the witnesses of my praise.</p>
<p><strong>[43:22]</strong> But you have made no prayer to me, O Jacob: and you have given no thought to me, O Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[43:23]</strong> You have not made me burned offerings of sheep, or given me honour with your offerings of beasts; I did not make you servants to give me an offering, and I did not make you tired with requests for perfumes.</p>
<p><strong>[43:24]</strong> You have not got me sweet-smelling plants with your money, or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings: but you have made me a servant to your sins, and you have made me tired with your evil doings.</p>
<p><strong>[43:25]</strong> I, even I, am he who takes away your sins; and I will no longer keep your evil doings in mind.</p>
<p><strong>[43:26]</strong> Put me in mind of this; let us take up the cause between us: put forward your cause, so that you may be seen to be in the right.</p>
<p><strong>[43:27]</strong> Your first father was a sinner, and your guides have gone against my word.</p>
<p><strong>[43:28]</strong> Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean, so I have made Jacob a curse, and Israel a thing of shame.</p>
<p><strong>[44:1]</strong> And now, give ear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself:</p>
<p><strong>[44:2]</strong> The Lord who made you, forming you in your mother&rsquo;s body, the Lord, your helper, says, Have no fear, O Jacob my servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have taken for myself.</p>
<p><strong>[44:3]</strong> For I will send water on the land needing it, and streams on the dry earth: I will let my spirit come down on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring.</p>
<p><strong>[44:4]</strong> And they will come up like grass in a well-watered field, like water-plants by the streams.</p>
<p><strong>[44:5]</strong> One will say, I am the Lord&rsquo;s; and another will give himself the name, Jacob; another will put a mark on his hand, I am the Lord&rsquo;s, and another will take the name of Israel for himself.</p>
<p><strong>[44:6]</strong> The Lord, the King of Israel, even the Lord of armies who has taken up his cause, says, I am the first and the last, and there is no God but me.</p>
<p><strong>[44:7]</strong> If there is one like me, let him come forward and say it, let him make it clear and put it in order before me: who has made clear in the past the things to come? let him make clear the future to me.</p>
<p><strong>[44:8]</strong> Have no fear, be strong in heart; have I not made it clear to you in the past, and let you see it? and you are my witnesses. Is there any God but me, or a Rock of whom I have no knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>[44:9]</strong> Those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing, and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them: and their servants see not, and have no knowledge; so they will be put to shame.</p>
<p><strong>[44:10]</strong> Whoever makes a god, makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit.</p>
<p><strong>[44:11]</strong> Truly, all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame, and their words of power are only words of men: let them all come forward together; they will all be in fear and be put to shame.</p>
<p><strong>[44:12]</strong> The iron-worker is heating the metal in the fire, giving it form with his hammers, and working on it with his strong arm: then for need of food his strength gives way, and for need of water he becomes feeble.</p>
<p><strong>[44:13]</strong> The woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line, marking it out with his pencil: after smoothing it with his plane, and making circles on it with his instrument, he gives it the form and glory of a man, so that it may be placed in the house.</p>
<p><strong>[44:14]</strong> He has cedars cut down for himself, he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood; he has an ash-tree planted, and the rain gives it growth.</p>
<p><strong>[44:15]</strong> Then it will be used to make a fire, so that a man may get warm; he has the oven heated with it and makes bread: he makes a god with it, to which he gives worship: he makes a pictured image out of it, and goes down on his face before it.</p>
<p><strong>[44:16]</strong> With part of it he makes a fire, and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal: he makes himself warm, and says, Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire:</p>
<p><strong>[44:17]</strong> And the rest of it he makes into a god, even his pictured image: he goes down on his face before it, giving worship to it, and making prayer to it, saying, Be my saviour; for you are my god.</p>
<p><strong>[44:18]</strong> They have no knowledge or wisdom; for he has put a veil over their eyes, so that they may not see; and on their hearts, so that they may not give attention.</p>
<p><strong>[44:19]</strong> And no one takes note, no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say, I have put part of it in the fire, and made bread on it; I have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it: and am I now to make the rest of it into a false god? am I to go down on my face before a bit of wood?</p>
<p><strong>[44:20]</strong> As for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire, he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind, so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying, What I have here in my hand is false.</p>
<p><strong>[44:21]</strong> Keep these things in mind, O Jacob; and you Israel, for you are my servant: I have made you; you are my servant; O Israel, I will not let you go out of my memory.</p>
<p><strong>[44:22]</strong> I have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud, and your sins like a mist: come back to me; for I have taken up your cause.</p>
<p><strong>[44:23]</strong> Make a song, O heavens, for the Lord has done it: give a loud cry, you deep parts of the earth: let your voices be loud in song, you mountains, and you woods with all your trees: for the Lord has taken up the cause of Jacob, and will let his glory be seen in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[44:24]</strong> The Lord, who has taken up your cause, and who gave you life in your mother&rsquo;s body, says, I am the Lord who makes all things; stretching out the heavens by myself, and giving the earth its limits; who was with me?</p>
<p><strong>[44:25]</strong> Who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing, so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads; turning the wise men back, and making their knowledge foolish:</p>
<p><strong>[44:26]</strong> Who makes the word of his servants certain, and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives; who says of Jerusalem, Her people will come back to her; and of the towns of Judah, I will give orders for their building, and will make her waste places fertile again:</p>
<p><strong>[44:27]</strong> Who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will make your rivers dry:</p>
<p><strong>[44:28]</strong> Who says of Cyrus, He will take care of my sheep, and will do all my pleasure: who says of Jerusalem, I will give the word for your building; and of the Temple, Your bases will be put in place.</p>
<p><strong>[45:1]</strong> The Lord says to the man of his selection, to Cyrus, whom I have taken by the right hand, putting down nations before him, and taking away the arms of kings; making the doors open before him, so that the ways into the towns may not be shut;</p>
<p><strong>[45:2]</strong> I will go before you, and make the rough places level: the doors of brass will be broken, and the iron rods cut in two:</p>
<p><strong>[45:3]</strong> And I will give you the stores of the dark, and the wealth of secret places, so that you may be certain that I am the Lord, who gave you your name, even the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[45:4]</strong> Because of Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself, I have sent for you by name, giving you a name of honour, though you had no knowledge of me.</p>
<p><strong>[45:5]</strong> I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God but me: I will make you ready for war, though you had no knowledge of me:</p>
<p><strong>[45:6]</strong> So that they may see from the east and from the west that there is no God but me: I am the Lord, and there is no other.</p>
<p><strong>[45:7]</strong> I am the giver of light and the maker of the dark; causing blessing, and sending troubles; I am the Lord, who does all these things.</p>
<p><strong>[45:8]</strong> Let righteousness come down, O heavens, from on high, and let the sky send it down like rain: let the earth be open to give the fruit of salvation, causing righteousness to come up with it; I the Lord have made it come about.</p>
<p><strong>[45:9]</strong> Cursed is he who has an argument with his Maker, the pot which has an argument with the Potter! Will the wet earth say to him who is working with it, What are you doing, that your work has nothing by which it may be gripped?</p>
<p><strong>[45:10]</strong> Cursed is he who says to a father, To what are you giving life? or to a woman, What are you in birth-pains with?</p>
<p><strong>[45:11]</strong> The Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, says, Will you put a question to me about the things which are to come, or will you give me orders about my sons, and the work of my hands?</p>
<p><strong>[45:12]</strong> I have made the earth, forming man on it: by my hands the heavens have been stretched out, and all the stars put in their ordered places.</p>
<p><strong>[45:13]</strong> I have sent him out to overcome the nations, and I will make all his ways straight: I will give him the work of building my town, and he will let my prisoners go free, without price or reward, says the Lord of armies.</p>
<p><strong>[45:14]</strong> The Lord says, The workmen of Egypt, and the traders of Ethiopia, and the tall Sabaeans, will come over the sea to you, and they will be yours; they will go after you; in chains they will come over: and they will go down on their faces before you, and will make prayer to you, saying, Truly, God is among you; and there is no other God.</p>
<p><strong>[45:15]</strong> Truly, you have a secret God, the God of Israel is a Saviour!</p>
<p><strong>[45:16]</strong> All those who have gone against him will be put to shame; the makers of images will be made low.</p>
<p><strong>[45:17]</strong> But the Lord will make Israel free with an eternal salvation: you will not be put to shame or made low for ever and ever.</p>
<p><strong>[45:18]</strong> For this is the word of the Lord who made the heavens; he is God; the maker and designer of the earth; who made it not to be a waste, but as a living-place for man: I am the Lord, and there is no other.</p>
<p><strong>[45:19]</strong> I have not given my word in secret, in a place in the underworld; I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Go into a waste land to make request of me: I the Lord say what is true, my word is righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[45:20]</strong> Come together, even come near, you nations who are still living: they have no knowledge who take up their image of wood, and make prayer to a god in whom is no salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[45:21]</strong> Give the word, put forward your cause, let us have a discussion together: who has given news of this in the past? who made it clear in early times? did not I, the Lord? and there is no God but me; a true God and a saviour; there is no other.</p>
<p><strong>[45:22]</strong> Let your hearts be turned to me, so that you may have salvation, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is no other.</p>
<p><strong>[45:23]</strong> By myself have I taken an oath, a true word has gone from my mouth, and will not be changed, that to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give honour.</p>
<p><strong>[45:24]</strong> Only in the Lord will Jacob overcome and be strong: together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[45:25]</strong> In the Lord will all the seed of Israel get their rights, and they will give glory to him.</p>
<p><strong>[46:1]</strong> Bel is bent down, Nebo is falling; their images are on the beasts and on the cattle: the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast.</p>
<p><strong>[46:2]</strong> They are bent down, they are falling together: they were not able to keep their images safe, but they themselves have been taken prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>[46:3]</strong> Give ear to me, O family of Jacob, and all the rest of the people of Israel, who have been supported by me from their birth, and have been my care from their earliest days:</p>
<p><strong>[46:4]</strong> Even when you are old I will be the same, and when you are grey-haired I will take care of you: I will still be responsible for what I made; yes, I will take you and keep you safe.</p>
<p><strong>[46:5]</strong> Who in your eyes is my equal? or what comparison will you make with me?</p>
<p><strong>[46:6]</strong> As for those who take gold out of a bag, and put silver in the scales, they give payment to a gold-worker, to make it into a god; they go down on their faces and give it worship.</p>
<p><strong>[46:7]</strong> They put him on their backs, and take him up, and put him in his fixed place, from which he may not be moved; if a man gives a cry for help to him, he is unable to give an answer, or get him out of his trouble.</p>
<p><strong>[46:8]</strong> Keep this in mind and be shamed; let it come back to your memory, you sinners.</p>
<p><strong>[46:9]</strong> Let the things which are past come to your memory: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me;</p>
<p><strong>[46:10]</strong> Making clear from the first what is to come, and from past times the things which have not so far come about; saying, My purpose is fixed, and I will do all my pleasure;</p>
<p><strong>[46:11]</strong> Sending for a bird of strong flight from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country; I have said it, and I will give effect to it; the thing designed by me will certainly be done.</p>
<p><strong>[46:12]</strong> Give ear to me, you feeble-hearted, who have no faith in my righteousness:</p>
<p><strong>[46:13]</strong> My righteousness is near, it is not far off; salvation will come quickly; and I will make Zion free, and give Israel my glory.</p>
<p><strong>[47:1]</strong> Come and take your seat in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; come down from your seat of power, and take your place on the earth, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will never again seem soft and delicate.</p>
<p><strong>[47:2]</strong> Take the crushing-stones and get the meal crushed: take off your veil, put away your robe, let your legs be uncovered, go through the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>[47:3]</strong> The shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all: I will give punishment without mercy,</p>
<p><strong>[47:4]</strong> Says the Lord who takes up our cause; the Lord of armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[47:5]</strong> Be seated in the dark without a word, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will no longer be named, The Queen of Kingdoms.</p>
<p><strong>[47:6]</strong> I was angry with my people, I put shame on my heritage, and gave them into your hands: you had no mercy on them; you put a cruel yoke on those who were old;</p>
<p><strong>[47:7]</strong> And you said, I will be a queen for ever: you did not give attention to these things, and did not keep in mind what would come after.</p>
<p><strong>[47:8]</strong> So now take note of this, you who are given up to pleasure, living without fear of evil, saying in your heart, I am, and there is no one like me; I will never be a widow, or have my children taken from me.</p>
<p><strong>[47:9]</strong> But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day, the loss of children and of husband: in full measure they will come on you, for all your secret arts, and all your wonders.</p>
<p><strong>[47:10]</strong> For you had faith in your evil-doing; you said, No one sees me; by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way: and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no other.</p>
<p><strong>[47:11]</strong> Because of this evil will come on you, which may not be turned away for any price: and trouble will overtake you, from which no money will give salvation: destruction will come on you suddenly, without your knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[47:12]</strong> Go on now with your secret arts, and all your wonder-working, to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days; it may be that they will be of profit to you, or by them you may put fear into your attackers.</p>
<p><strong>[47:13]</strong> But your mind is troubled by the number of your guides: let them now come forward for your salvation: the measurers of the heavens, the watchers of the stars, and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you.</p>
<p><strong>[47:14]</strong> Truly, they have become like dry stems, they have been burned in the fire; they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame: it is not a coal for warming them, or a fire by which a man may be seated.</p>
<p><strong>[47:15]</strong> Small profit have you had from those who, from your earliest days, got great profit out of you; they have gone in flight, every one straight before him, and you have no saviour.</p>
<p><strong>[48:1]</strong> Give ear to this, O family of Jacob, you who are named by the name of Israel, and have come out of the body of Judah; who take oaths by the name of the Lord, and make use of the name of the God of Israel, but not truly and not in good faith.</p>
<p><strong>[48:2]</strong> For they say that they are of the holy town, and put their faith in the God of Israel: the Lord of armies is his name.</p>
<p><strong>[48:3]</strong> I gave word in the past of the things which came about; they came from my mouth, and I made them clear: suddenly I did them, and they came about.</p>
<p><strong>[48:4]</strong> Because I saw that your heart was hard, and that your neck was an iron cord, and your brow brass;</p>
<p><strong>[48:5]</strong> For this reason I made it clear to you in the past, before it came I gave you word of it: for fear that you might say, My god did these things, and my pictured and metal images made them come about.</p>
<p><strong>[48:6]</strong> All this has come to your ears and you have seen it; will you not give witness to it? I am now making clear new things, even secret things, of which you had no knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>[48:7]</strong> They have only now been effected, and not in the past: and before this day they had not come to your ears; for fear that you might say, I had knowledge of them.</p>
<p><strong>[48:8]</strong> Truly you had no word of them, no knowledge of them; no news of them in the past had come to your ears; because I saw how false was your behaviour, and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days.</p>
<p><strong>[48:9]</strong> Because of my name I will put away my wrath, and for my praise I will keep myself from cutting you off.</p>
<p><strong>[48:10]</strong> See, I have been testing you for myself like silver; I have put you through the fire of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>[48:11]</strong> For myself, even because of my name, I will do it; for I will not let my name be shamed; and my glory I will not give to another.</p>
<p><strong>[48:12]</strong> Give ear to me, Jacob, and Israel, my loved one; I am he, I am the first and I am the last.</p>
<p><strong>[48:13]</strong> Yes, by my hand was the earth placed on its base, and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out; at my word they take up their places.</p>
<p><strong>[48:14]</strong> Come together, all of you, and give ear; who among you has given news of these things? the Lord&rsquo;s loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon, and with the seed of the Chaldaeans.</p>
<p><strong>[48:15]</strong> I, even I, have given the word; I have sent for him: I have made him come, and have given effect to his undertakings.</p>
<p><strong>[48:16]</strong> Come near to me, and give ear to this; from the start I did not keep it secret; from the time of its coming into existence I was there: and now the Lord God has sent me, and given me his spirit.</p>
<p><strong>[48:17]</strong> The Lord who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, I am the Lord your God, who is teaching you for your profit, guiding you by the way in which you are to go.</p>
<p><strong>[48:18]</strong> If only you had given ear to my orders, then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</p>
<p><strong>[48:19]</strong> Your seed would have been like the sand, and your offspring like the dust: your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me.</p>
<p><strong>[48:20]</strong> Go out of Babylon, go in flight from the Chaldaeans; with the sound of song make it clear, give the news, let the word go out even to the end of the earth: say, The Lord has taken up the cause of his servant Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[48:21]</strong> They had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands: he made water come out of the rock for them: the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out.</p>
<p><strong>[48:22]</strong> There is no peace, says the Lord, for the evil-doers.</p>
<p><strong>[49:1]</strong> Give ear, O sea-lands, to me; and take note, you peoples from far: I have been marked out by the Lord from the first; when I was still in my mother&rsquo;s body, he had my name in mind:</p>
<p><strong>[49:2]</strong> And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shade of his hand he has kept me; and he has made me like a polished arrow, keeping me in his secret place;</p>
<p><strong>[49:3]</strong> And he said to me, You are my servant, Israel, in whom my glory will be seen;</p>
<p><strong>[49:4]</strong> And I said, I have undergone weariness for nothing, I have given my strength for no purpose or profit: but still the Lord will take up my cause, and my God will give me my reward.</p>
<p><strong>[49:5]</strong> And now, says the Lord, who made me his servant when I was still in my mother&rsquo;s body, so that I might make Jacob come back to him, and so that Israel might come together to him: and I was honoured in the eyes of the Lord, and my God became my strength.</p>
<p><strong>[49:6]</strong> It is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of Jacob again in their place, and to get back those of Israel who have been sent away: my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations, so that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[49:7]</strong> The Lord who takes up Israel&rsquo;s cause, even his Holy One, says to him whom men make sport of, who is hated by the nations, a servant of rulers: Kings will see and get up from their places, and chiefs will give worship: because of the Lord who keeps faith; even the Holy One of Israel who has taken you for himself.</p>
<p><strong>[49:8]</strong> This is the word of the Lord: I have given ear to you at a good time, and I have been your helper in a day of salvation: and I will keep you safe, and will make you a glory for the people, putting the land in order, and giving them the heritages which now are waste;</p>
<p><strong>[49:9]</strong> Saying to those who are in chains, Go free; to those who are in the dark, Come out into the light. They will get food by the way wherever they go, and have grass-lands on all the dry mountain-tops.</p>
<p><strong>[49:10]</strong> They will not be in need of food or drink, or be troubled by the heat or the sun: for he who has mercy on them will be their guide, taking them by the springs of water.</p>
<p><strong>[49:11]</strong> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be lifted up.</p>
<p><strong>[49:12]</strong> See, these are coming from far; and these from the north and the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</p>
<p><strong>[49:13]</strong> Let your voice be loud in song, O heavens; and be glad, O earth; make sounds of joy, O mountains, for the Lord has given comfort to his people, and will have mercy on his crushed ones.</p>
<p><strong>[49:14]</strong> But Zion said, The Lord has given me up, I have gone from his memory.</p>
<p><strong>[49:15]</strong> Will a woman give up the child at her breast, will she be without pity for the fruit of her body? yes, these may, but I will not let you go out of my memory.</p>
<p><strong>[49:16]</strong> See, your name is marked on my hands; your walls are ever before me.</p>
<p><strong>[49:17]</strong> Your builders are coming quickly; your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you.</p>
<p><strong>[49:18]</strong> Let your eyes be lifted up round about, and see: they are all coming together to you. By my life, says the Lord, truly you will put them all on you as an ornament, and be clothed with them like a bride.</p>
<p><strong>[49:19]</strong> For though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction, now you will not be wide enough for your people, and those who made you waste will be far away.</p>
<p><strong>[49:20]</strong> The children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears, The place is not wide enough for me: make room for me to have a resting-place.</p>
<p><strong>[49:21]</strong> Then you will say in your heart, Who has given me all these children? when my children had been taken from me, and I was no longer able to have others, who took care of these? when I was by myself, where then were these?</p>
<p><strong>[49:22]</strong> This is the word of the Lord God: See, I will make a sign with my hand to the nations, and put up my flag for the peoples; and they will take up your sons on their beasts, and your daughters on their backs.</p>
<p><strong>[49:23]</strong> And kings will take care of you, and queens will give you their milk: they will go down on their faces before you, kissing the dust of your feet; and you will be certain that I am the Lord, and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed.</p>
<p><strong>[49:24]</strong> Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man, or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go?</p>
<p><strong>[49:25]</strong> But the Lord says, Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him, and the cruel made to let go his goods: for I will take up your cause against your haters, and I will keep your children safe.</p>
<p><strong>[49:26]</strong> And the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food; and they will take their blood for drink, as if it was sweet wine: and all men will see that I the Lord am your saviour, even he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[50:1]</strong> This is the word of the Lord: Where is the statement which I gave your mother when I put her away? or to which of my creditors have I given you for money? It was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others, and for your evil-doing was your mother put away.</p>
<p><strong>[50:2]</strong> Why, then, when I came, was there no man? and no one to give answer to my voice? has my hand become feeble, so that it is unable to take up your cause? or have I no power to make you free? See, at my word the sea becomes dry, I make the rivers a waste land: their fish are dead for need of water, and make an evil smell.</p>
<p><strong>[50:3]</strong> By me the heavens are clothed with black, and I make haircloth their robe.</p>
<p><strong>[50:4]</strong> The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are experienced, so that I may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble: every morning my ear is open to his teaching, like those who are experienced:</p>
<p><strong>[50:5]</strong> And I have not put myself against him, or let my heart be turned back from him.</p>
<p><strong>[50:6]</strong> I was offering my back to those who gave me blows, and my face to those who were pulling out my hair: I did not keep my face covered from marks of shame.</p>
<p><strong>[50:7]</strong> For the Lord God is my helper; I will not be put to shame: so I have made my face like a rock, and I am certain that he will give me my right.</p>
<p><strong>[50:8]</strong> He who takes up my cause is near; who will go to law with me? let us come together before the judge: who is against me? let him come near to me.</p>
<p><strong>[50:9]</strong> See, the Lord God is my helper; who will give a decision against me? truly, all of them will become old like a robe; they will be food for the worm.</p>
<p><strong>[50:10]</strong> Who among you has the fear of the Lord, giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light? Let him put his faith in the name of the Lord, looking to his God for support.</p>
<p><strong>[50:11]</strong> See, all you who make a fire, arming yourselves with burning branches: go in the flame of your fire, and among the branches you have put a light to. This will you have from my hand, you will make your bed in sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>[51:1]</strong> Give ear to me, you who are searching for righteousness, who are looking for the Lord: see the rock from which you were cut out, and the hole out of which you were taken.</p>
<p><strong>[51:2]</strong> Let your thoughts be turned to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth: for when he was but one, my voice came to him, and I gave him my blessing, and made him a great people.</p>
<p><strong>[51:3]</strong> For the Lord has given comfort to Zion: he has made glad all her broken walls; making her waste places like Eden, and changing her dry land into the garden of the Lord; joy and delight will be there, praise and the sound of melody.</p>
<p><strong>[51:4]</strong> Give attention to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation; for teaching will go out from me, and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples.</p>
<p><strong>[51:5]</strong> Suddenly will my righteousness come near, and my salvation will be shining out like the light; the sea-lands will be waiting for me, and they will put their hope in my strong arm.</p>
<p><strong>[51:6]</strong> Let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens, and turned to the earth which is under them: for the heavens will go in flight like smoke, and the earth will become old like a coat, and its people will come to destruction like insects: but my salvation will be for ever, and my righteousness will not come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[51:7]</strong> Give ear to me, you who have knowledge of righteousness, in whose heart is my law; have no fear of the evil words of men, and give no thought to their curses.</p>
<p><strong>[51:8]</strong> For like a coat they will be food for the insect, the worm will make a meal of them like wool: but my righteousness will be for ever, and my salvation to all generations.</p>
<p><strong>[51:9]</strong> Awake! awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord, awake! as in the old days, in the generations long past. Was it not by you that Rahab was cut in two, and the dragon Wounded?</p>
<p><strong>[51:10]</strong> Did you not make the sea dry, the waters of the great deep? did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the Lord&rsquo;s people to go through?</p>
<p><strong>[51:11]</strong> Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion; and on their heads will be eternal joy: delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[51:12]</strong> I, even I, am your comforter: are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end, and of the son of man who will be like grass?</p>
<p><strong>[51:13]</strong> And you have given no thought to the Lord your Maker, by whom the heavens were stretched out, and the earth placed on its base; and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one, when he was making ready for your destruction. And where is the wrath of the cruel one?</p>
<p><strong>[51:14]</strong> The prisoner, bent under his chain, will quickly be made free, and will not go down into the underworld, and his bread will not come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>[51:15]</strong> For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.</p>
<p><strong>[51:16]</strong> And I have put my words in your mouth, covering you with the shade of my hand, stretching out the heavens, and placing the earth on its base, and saying to Zion, You are my people.</p>
<p><strong>[51:17]</strong> Awake! awake! up! O Jerusalem, you who have taken from the Lord&rsquo;s hand the cup of his wrath; tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes.</p>
<p><strong>[51:18]</strong> She has no one among all her children to be her guide; not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand.</p>
<p><strong>[51:19]</strong> These two things have come on you; who will be weeping for you? wasting and destruction; death from need of food, and from the sword; how may you be comforted?</p>
<p><strong>[51:20]</strong> Your sons are overcome, like a roe in a net; they are full of the wrath of the Lord, the punishment of your God.</p>
<p><strong>[51:21]</strong> So now give ear to this, you who are troubled and overcome, but not with wine:</p>
<p><strong>[51:22]</strong> This is the word of the Lord your master, even your God who takes up the cause of his people: See, I have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes, even the cup of my wrath; it will not again be given to you:</p>
<p><strong>[51:23]</strong> And I will put it into the hand of your cruel masters, and of those whose yoke has been hard on you; who have said to your soul, Down on your face! so that we may go over you: and you have given your backs like the earth, even like the street, for them to go over.</p>
<p><strong>[52:1]</strong> Awake! awake! put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy town: for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision.</p>
<p><strong>[52:2]</strong> Make yourself clean from the dust; up! and take the seat of your power, O Jerusalem: the bands of your neck are loose, O prisoned daughter of Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[52:3]</strong> For the Lord says, You were given for nothing, and you will be made free without price.</p>
<p><strong>[52:4]</strong> For the Lord God says, My people went down at first into Egypt, to get a place for themselves there: and the Assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause.</p>
<p><strong>[52:5]</strong> Now then, what have I here? says the Lord, for my people are taken away without cause; they are made waste and give cries of sorrow, says the Lord, and all the day the nations put shame on my name.</p>
<p><strong>[52:6]</strong> For this cause I will make my name clear to my people; in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them; see, here am I.</p>
<p><strong>[52:7]</strong> How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news, who gives word of peace, saying that salvation is near; who says to Zion, Your God is ruling!</p>
<p><strong>[52:8]</strong> The voice of your watchmen! their voices are loud in song together; for they will see him, eye to eye, when the Lord comes back to Zion.</p>
<p><strong>[52:9]</strong> Give sounds of joy, make melody together, waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord has given comfort to his people, he has taken up the cause of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[52:10]</strong> The Lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations; and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.</p>
<p><strong>[52:11]</strong> Away! away! go out from there, touching no unclean thing; go out from among her; be clean, you who take up the vessels of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[52:12]</strong> For you will not go out suddenly, and you will not go in flight: for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will come after you to keep you.</p>
<p><strong>[52:13]</strong> See, my servant will do well in his undertakings, he will be honoured, and lifted up, and be very high.</p>
<p><strong>[52:14]</strong> As peoples were surprised at him, And his face was not beautiful, so as to be desired: his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man, and his form was no longer that of the sons of men.</p>
<p><strong>[52:15]</strong> So will nations give him honour; kings will keep quiet because of him: for what had not been made clear to them they will see; and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears.</p>
<p><strong>[53:1]</strong> Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled?</p>
<p><strong>[53:2]</strong> For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure;</p>
<p><strong>[53:3]</strong> Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men&rsquo;s faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him.</p>
<p><strong>[53:4]</strong> But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God&rsquo;s punishment had come.</p>
<p><strong>[53:5]</strong> But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well.</p>
<p><strong>[53:6]</strong> We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all.</p>
<p><strong>[53:7]</strong> Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word.</p>
<p><strong>[53:8]</strong> They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people.</p>
<p><strong>[53:9]</strong> And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>[53:10]</strong> And the Lord was pleased &hellip; see a seed, long life, &hellip; will do well in his hand. &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>[53:11]</strong> &hellip; made clear his righteousness before men &hellip; had taken their sins on himself.</p>
<p><strong>[53:12]</strong> For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers.</p>
<p><strong>[54:1]</strong> Let your voice be loud in song, O woman without children; make melody and sounds of joy, you who did not give birth: for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[54:2]</strong> Make wide the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit: make your cords long, and your tent-pins strong.</p>
<p><strong>[54:3]</strong> For I will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left; and your seed will take the nations for a heritage, and make the waste towns full of people.</p>
<p><strong>[54:4]</strong> Have no fear; for you will not be shamed or without hope: you will not be put to shame, for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory, and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years.</p>
<p><strong>[54:5]</strong> For your Maker is your husband; the Lord of armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is he who takes up your cause; he will be named the God of all the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[54:6]</strong> For the Lord has made you come back to him, like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit; for one may not give up the wife of one&rsquo;s early days.</p>
<p><strong>[54:7]</strong> For a short time I gave you up; but with great mercies I will take you back again.</p>
<p><strong>[54:8]</strong> In overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute, but I will have pity on you for ever, says the Lord who takes up your cause.</p>
<p><strong>[54:9]</strong> For this is like the days of Noah to me: for as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so have I taken an oath that I will not again be angry with you, or say bitter words to you.</p>
<p><strong>[54:10]</strong> For the mountains may be taken away, and the hills be moved out of their places, but my love will not be taken from you, or my agreement of peace broken, says the Lord, who has had mercy on you.</p>
<p><strong>[54:11]</strong> O troubled one, storm-crushed, uncomforted! see, your stones will be framed in fair colours, and your bases will be sapphires.</p>
<p><strong>[54:12]</strong> I will make your towers of rubies, and your doors of carbuncles, and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones.</p>
<p><strong>[54:13]</strong> And all your builders will be made wise by the Lord; and great will be the peace of your children.</p>
<p><strong>[54:14]</strong> All your rights will be made certain to you: have no fear of evil, and destruction will not come near you.</p>
<p><strong>[54:15]</strong> See, they may be moved to war, but not by my authority: all those who come together to make an attack on you, will be broken against you.</p>
<p><strong>[54:16]</strong> See, I have made the iron-worker, blowing on the burning coals, and making the instrument of war by his work; and I have made the waster for destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[54:17]</strong> No instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use; and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness comes from me, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[55:1]</strong> Ho! everyone in need, come to the waters, and he who has no strength, let him get food: come, get bread without money; wine and milk without price.</p>
<p><strong>[55:2]</strong> Why do you give your money for what is not bread, and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure? Give ear to me, so that your food may be good, and you may have the best in full measure.</p>
<p><strong>[55:3]</strong> Give ear, and come to me, take note with care, so that your souls may have life: and I will make an eternal agreement with you, even the certain mercies of David.</p>
<p><strong>[55:4]</strong> See, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, a ruler and a guide to the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[55:5]</strong> See, you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge, and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you, because of the Lord your God, and because of the Holy One of Israel, for he has given you glory.</p>
<p><strong>[55:6]</strong> Make search for the Lord while he is there, make prayer to him while he is near:</p>
<p><strong>[55:7]</strong> Let the sinner give up his way, and the evil-doer his purpose: and let him come back to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for there is full forgiveness with him.</p>
<p><strong>[55:8]</strong> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, or your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[55:9]</strong> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>[55:10]</strong> For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not go back again, but gives water to the earth, and makes it fertile, giving seed to the planter, and bread for food;</p>
<p><strong>[55:11]</strong> So will my word be which goes out of my mouth: it will not come back to me with nothing done, but it will give effect to my purpose, and do that for which I have sent it.</p>
<p><strong>[55:12]</strong> For you will go out with joy, and be guided in peace: the mountains and the hills will make melody before you, and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy.</p>
<p><strong>[55:13]</strong> In place of the thorn will come up the fir-tree, and in place of the blackberry the myrtle: and it will be to the Lord for a name, for an eternal sign which will not be cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[56:1]</strong> The Lord says, Let your way of life be upright, and let your behaviour be rightly ordered: for my salvation is near, and my righteousness will quickly be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[56:2]</strong> Happy is the man who does this, and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered; who keeps the Sabbath holy, and his hand from doing any evil.</p>
<p><strong>[56:3]</strong> And let not the man from a strange country, who has been joined to the Lord, say, The Lord will certainly put a division between me and his people: and let not the unsexed man say, See, I am a dry tree.</p>
<p><strong>[56:4]</strong> For the Lord says, As for the unsexed who keep my Sabbaths, and give their hearts to pleasing me, and keep their agreement with me:</p>
<p><strong>[56:5]</strong> I will give to them in my house, and inside my walls, a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off.</p>
<p><strong>[56:6]</strong> And as for those from a strange country, who are joined to the Lord, to give worship to him and honour to his name, to be his servants, even everyone who keeps the Sabbath holy, and keeps his agreement with me:</p>
<p><strong>[56:7]</strong> I will make them come to my holy mountain, and will give them joy in my house of prayer; I will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar: for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples.</p>
<p><strong>[56:8]</strong> The Lord God, who gets together the wandering ones of Israel, says, I will get together others in addition to those of Israel who have come back.</p>
<p><strong>[56:9]</strong> All you beasts of the field, come together for your meat, even all you beasts of the wood.</p>
<p><strong>[56:10]</strong> His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dogs without tongues, unable to make a sound; stretched out dreaming, loving sleep.</p>
<p><strong>[56:11]</strong> Yes, the dogs are for ever looking for food; while these, the keepers of the sheep, are without wisdom: they have all gone after their pleasure, every one looking for profit; they are all the same.</p>
<p><strong>[56:12]</strong> Come, they say, I will get wine, and we will take strong drink in full measure; and tomorrow will be like today, full of pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>[57:1]</strong> The upright man goes to his death, and no one gives a thought to it; and god-fearing men are taken away, and no one is troubled by it; for the upright man is taken away because of evil-doing, and goes into peace.</p>
<p><strong>[57:2]</strong> They are at rest in their last resting-places, every one going straight before him.</p>
<p><strong>[57:3]</strong> But come near, you sons of her who is wise in secret arts, the seed of her who is false to her husband, and of the loose woman.</p>
<p><strong>[57:4]</strong> Of whom do you make sport? against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out? are you not uncontrolled children, a false seed,</p>
<p><strong>[57:5]</strong> You who are burning with evil desire among the oaks, under every green tree; putting children to death in the valleys, under the cracks of the rocks?</p>
<p><strong>[57:6]</strong> Among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage; they, even they, are your part: even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering. Is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me?</p>
<p><strong>[57:7]</strong> You have put your bed on a high mountain: there you went up to make your offering.</p>
<p><strong>[57:8]</strong> And on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign: for you have been false to me with another; you have made your bed wide, and made an agreement with them; you had a desire for their bed where you saw it</p>
<p><strong>[57:9]</strong> And you went to Melech with oil and much perfume, and you sent your representatives far off, and went as low as the underworld.</p>
<p><strong>[57:10]</strong> You were tired with your long journeys; but you did not say, There is no hope: you got new strength, and so you were not feeble.</p>
<p><strong>[57:11]</strong> And of whom were you in fear, so that you were false, and did not keep me in mind, or give thought to it? Have I not been quiet, keeping myself secret, and so you were not in fear of me?</p>
<p><strong>[57:12]</strong> I will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works; you will have no profit in them.</p>
<p><strong>[57:13]</strong> Your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry; but the wind will take them, they will be gone like a breath: but he who puts his hope in me will take the land, and will have my holy mountain as his heritage.</p>
<p><strong>[57:14]</strong> And I will say, Make it high, make it high, get ready the way, take the stones out of the way of my people.</p>
<p><strong>[57:15]</strong> For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up, whose resting-place is eternal, whose name is Holy: my resting-place is in the high and holy place, and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit, to give life to the spirit of the poor, and to make strong the heart of the crushed.</p>
<p><strong>[57:16]</strong> For I will not give punishment for ever, or be angry without end: for from me breath goes out; and I it was who made the souls.</p>
<p><strong>[57:17]</strong> I was quickly angry with his evil ways, and sent punishment on him, veiling my face in wrath: and he went on, turning his heart from me.</p>
<p><strong>[57:18]</strong> I have seen his ways, and I will make him well: I will give him rest, comforting him and his people who are sad.</p>
<p><strong>[57:19]</strong> I will give the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is near and to him who is far off, says the Lord; and I will make him well.</p>
<p><strong>[57:20]</strong> But the evil-doers are like the troubled sea, for which there is no rest, and its waters send up earth and waste.</p>
<p><strong>[57:21]</strong> There is no peace, says my God, for the evil-doers.</p>
<p><strong>[58:1]</strong> Make a loud cry, do not be quiet, let your voice be sounding like a horn, and make clear to my people their evil doings, and to the family of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p><strong>[58:2]</strong> Though they make prayer to me every day, and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways: like a nation which has done righteousness, and has not given up the rules of their God, they make requests to me for the right orders, it is their delight to come near to God.</p>
<p><strong>[58:3]</strong> They say, Why have we kept ourselves from food, and you do not see it? why have we kept ourselves from pleasure, and you take no note of it? If, in the days when you keep from food, you take the chance to do your business, and get in your debts;</p>
<p><strong>[58:4]</strong> If keeping from food makes you quickly angry, ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands; your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high.</p>
<p><strong>[58:5]</strong> Have I given orders for such a day as this? a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure? is it only a question of the bent head, of putting on haircloth, and being seated in the dust? is this what seems to you a holy day, well-pleasing to the Lord?</p>
<p><strong>[58:6]</strong> Is not this the holy day for which I have given orders: to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the crushed go free, and every yoke be broken?</p>
<p><strong>[58:7]</strong> Is it not to give your bread to those in need, and to let the poor who have no resting-place come into your house? to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him, and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh?</p>
<p><strong>[58:8]</strong> Then will light be shining on you like the morning, and your wounds will quickly be well: and your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will come after you.</p>
<p><strong>[58:9]</strong> Then at the sound of your voice, the Lord will give an answer; at your cry he will say, Here am I. If you take away from among you the yoke, the putting out of the finger of shame, and the evil word;</p>
<p><strong>[58:10]</strong> And if you give your bread to those in need of it, so that the troubled one may have his desire; then you will have light in the dark, and your night will be as the full light of the sun:</p>
<p><strong>[58:11]</strong> And the Lord will be your guide at all times; in dry places he will give you water in full measure, and will make strong your bones; and you will be like a watered garden, and like an ever-flowing spring.</p>
<p><strong>[58:12]</strong> And your sons will be building again the old waste places: you will make strong the bases of old generations: and you will be named, He who puts up the broken walls, and, He who makes ready the ways for use.</p>
<p><strong>[58:13]</strong> If you keep the Sabbath with care, not doing your business on my holy day; and if the Sabbath seems to you a delight, and the new moon of the Lord a thing to be honoured; and if you give respect to him by not doing your business, or going after your pleasure, or saying unholy words;</p>
<p><strong>[58:14]</strong> Then the Lord will be your delight; and I will put you on the high places of the earth; and I will give you the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the Lord has said it.</p>
<p><strong>[59:1]</strong> Truly, the Lord&rsquo;s hand has not become short, so that he is unable to give salvation; and his ear is not shut from hearing:</p>
<p><strong>[59:2]</strong> But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer.</p>
<p><strong>[59:3]</strong> For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit.</p>
<p><strong>[59:4]</strong> No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil.</p>
<p><strong>[59:5]</strong> They give birth to snake&rsquo;s eggs, and make spider&rsquo;s threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake.</p>
<p><strong>[59:6]</strong> Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>[59:7]</strong> Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways.</p>
<p><strong>[59:8]</strong> They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace.</p>
<p><strong>[59:9]</strong> For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night.</p>
<p><strong>[59:10]</strong> We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men.</p>
<p><strong>[59:11]</strong> We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us.</p>
<p><strong>[59:12]</strong> For our evil doings are increased before you, and our sins give witness against us: for our evil doings are with us, and we have knowledge of our sins:</p>
<p><strong>[59:13]</strong> We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit.</p>
<p><strong>[59:14]</strong> And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town.</p>
<p><strong>[59:15]</strong> Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause.</p>
<p><strong>[59:16]</strong> And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support.</p>
<p><strong>[59:17]</strong> Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe.</p>
<p><strong>[59:18]</strong> He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment.</p>
<p><strong>[59:19]</strong> So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[59:20]</strong> And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[59:21]</strong> And as for me, this is my agreement with them, says the Lord: my spirit which is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not go away from your mouth, or from the mouth of your seed, or from the mouth of your seed&rsquo;s seed, says the Lord, from now and for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[60:1]</strong> Up! let your face be bright, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord is shining on you.</p>
<p><strong>[60:2]</strong> For truly, the earth will be dark, and the peoples veiled in blackest night; but the Lord will be shining on you, and his glory will be seen among you.</p>
<p><strong>[60:3]</strong> And nations will come to your light, and kings to your bright dawn.</p>
<p><strong>[60:4]</strong> Let your eyes be lifted up, and see: they are all coming together to you: your sons will come from far, and your daughters taken with loving care.</p>
<p><strong>[60:5]</strong> Then you will see, and be bright with joy, and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight: for the produce of the sea will be turned to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.</p>
<p><strong>[60:6]</strong> You will be full of camel-trains, even the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all from Sheba will come, with gold and spices, giving word of the great acts of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[60:7]</strong> All the flocks of Kedar will come together to you, the sheep of Nebaioth will be ready for your need; they will be pleasing offerings on my altar, and my house of prayer will be beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>[60:8]</strong> Who are these coming like a cloud, like a flight of doves to their windows?</p>
<p><strong>[60:9]</strong> Vessels of the sea-lands are waiting for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, so that your sons may come from far, and their silver and gold with them, to the place of the name of the Lord your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has made you beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>[60:10]</strong> And men from strange countries will be building up your walls, and their kings will be your servants: for in my wrath I sent punishment on you, but in my grace I have had mercy on you.</p>
<p><strong>[60:11]</strong> Your doors will be open at all times; they will not be shut day or night; so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations, with their kings at their head.</p>
<p><strong>[60:12]</strong> For the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction; such nations will be completely waste.</p>
<p><strong>[60:13]</strong> The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the sherbin-tree together, to make my holy place beautiful; and the resting-place of my feet will be full of glory.</p>
<p><strong>[60:14]</strong> And the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads; and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet; and you will be named, The Town of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>[60:15]</strong> And though you were turned away from, and hated, and had no helper, I will make you a pride for ever, a joy from generation to generation.</p>
<p><strong>[60:16]</strong> And you will take the milk of the nations, flowing from the breast of kings; and you will see that I, the Lord, am your saviour, and he who takes up your cause, the Strong One of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>[60:17]</strong> In place of brass, I will give gold, and for iron silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: and I will make Peace your judge, and Righteousness your overseer.</p>
<p><strong>[60:18]</strong> Violent acts will no longer be seen in your land, wasting or destruction in your limits; but your walls will be named, Salvation, and your doors Praise.</p>
<p><strong>[60:19]</strong> The sun will not be your light by day, and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night: but the Lord will be to you an eternal light, and your God your glory.</p>
<p><strong>[60:20]</strong> Your sun will never again go down, or your moon keep back her light: for the Lord will be your eternal light, and the days of your sorrow will be ended.</p>
<p><strong>[60:21]</strong> Your people will all be upright, the land will be their heritage for ever; the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, to be for my glory.</p>
<p><strong>[60:22]</strong> The smallest of their families will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, the Lord, will make it come quickly in its time.</p>
<p><strong>[61:1]</strong> The spirit of the Lord is on me, because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor; he has sent me to make the broken-hearted well, to say that the prisoners will be made free, and that those in chains will see the light again;</p>
<p><strong>[61:2]</strong> To give knowledge that the year of the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure has come, and the day of punishment from our God; to give comfort to all who are sad;</p>
<p><strong>[61:3]</strong> To give them a fair head-dress in place of dust, the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief, praise in place of sorrow; so that they may be named trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, and so that he may have glory.</p>
<p><strong>[61:4]</strong> And they will be building again the old broken walls, and will make new the old waste places, and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations.</p>
<p><strong>[61:5]</strong> And men from strange countries will be your herdsmen, and those who are not Israelites will be your ploughmen and vine-keepers.</p>
<p><strong>[61:6]</strong> But you will be named the priests of the Lord, the servants of our God: you will have the wealth of the nations for your food, and you will be clothed with their glory.</p>
<p><strong>[61:7]</strong> As they had twice as much grief, and marks of shame were their heritage, so in their land they will be rewarded twice over, and will have eternal joy.</p>
<p><strong>[61:8]</strong> For I, the Lord, take pleasure in upright judging; I will not put up with the violent taking away of right; and I will certainly give them their reward, and I will make an eternal agreement with them.</p>
<p><strong>[61:9]</strong> And their seed will be noted among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples: it will be clear to all who see them that they are the seed to which the Lord has given his blessing.</p>
<p><strong>[61:10]</strong> I will be full of joy in the Lord, my soul will be glad in my God; for he has put on me the clothing of salvation, covering me with the robe of righteousness, as the husband puts on a fair head-dress, and the bride makes herself beautiful with jewels.</p>
<p><strong>[61:11]</strong> For as the earth puts out buds, and as the garden gives growth to the seeds which are planted in it, so the Lord will make righteousness and praise to be flowering before all the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[62:1]</strong> Because of Zion I will not keep quiet, and because of Jerusalem I will take no rest, till her righteousness goes out like the shining of the sun, and her salvation like a burning light.</p>
<p><strong>[62:2]</strong> And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you will have a new name, given by the mouth of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[62:3]</strong> And you will be a fair crown in the hand of the Lord, and a king&rsquo;s head-dress in the hand of your God.</p>
<p><strong>[62:4]</strong> You will not now be named, She who is given up; and your land will no longer be named, The waste land: but you will have the name, My pleasure is in her, and your land will be named, Married: for the Lord has pleasure in you, and your land will be married.</p>
<p><strong>[62:5]</strong> For as a young man takes a virgin for his wife, so will your maker be married to you: and as a husband has joy in his bride, so will the Lord your God be glad over you.</p>
<p><strong>[62:6]</strong> I have put watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will not keep quiet day or night: you who are the Lord&rsquo;s recorders, take no rest,</p>
<p><strong>[62:7]</strong> And give him no rest, till he puts Jerusalem in her place to be praised in the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[62:8]</strong> The Lord has taken an oath by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Truly, I will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters; and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has been done:</p>
<p><strong>[62:9]</strong> But those who have got in the grain will have it for their food, and will give praise to the Lord; and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house.</p>
<p><strong>[62:10]</strong> Go through, go through the doors; make ready the way of the people; let the highway be lifted up; let the stones be taken away; let a flag be lifted up over the peoples.</p>
<p><strong>[62:11]</strong> The Lord has sent out word to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your saviour comes; those whom he has made free are with him, and those to whom he has given salvation go before him.</p>
<p><strong>[62:12]</strong> And they will be named, The holy people, Those whose cause has been taken up by the Lord: and you will be named, Desired, A town not given up.</p>
<p><strong>[63:1]</strong> Who is this who comes from Edom, with blood-red robes from Bozrah? he whose clothing is fair, stepping with pride in his great strength? I whose glory is in the right, strong for salvation.</p>
<p><strong>[63:2]</strong> Why is your clothing red, and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes?</p>
<p><strong>[63:3]</strong> I have been crushing the grapes by myself, and of the peoples there was no man with me: in my wrath and in my passion, they were crushed under my feet; and my robes are marked with their life-blood, and all my clothing is red.</p>
<p><strong>[63:4]</strong> For the day of punishment is in my heart, and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come.</p>
<p><strong>[63:5]</strong> And I saw that there was no helper, and I was wondering that no one gave them support: so my arm did the work of salvation, and my wrath was my support.</p>
<p><strong>[63:6]</strong> And in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet, and broken in my wrath, and I put down their strength to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>[63:7]</strong> I will give news of the mercies of the Lord, and his great acts, even all the things the Lord has done for us, in his great grace to the house of Israel; even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies.</p>
<p><strong>[63:8]</strong> For he said, Truly they are my people, children who will not be false: so he was their saviour out of all their trouble.</p>
<p><strong>[63:9]</strong> It was no sent one or angel, but he himself who was their saviour: in his love and in his pity he took up their cause, and he took them in his arms, caring for them all through the years.</p>
<p><strong>[63:10]</strong> But they went against him, causing grief to his holy spirit: so he was turned against them, and made war on them.</p>
<p><strong>[63:11]</strong> Then the early days came to their minds, the days of Moses his servant: and they said, Where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea? where is he who put his holy spirit among them,</p>
<p><strong>[63:12]</strong> He who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of Moses, by whom the waters were parted before them, to make himself an eternal name;</p>
<p><strong>[63:13]</strong> He who made them go through the deep waters, like a horse in the waste land?</p>
<p><strong>[63:14]</strong> Like the cattle which go down into the valley, they went without falling, the spirit of the Lord guiding them: so you went before your people, to make yourself a great name.</p>
<p><strong>[63:15]</strong> Let your eyes be looking down from heaven, from your holy and beautiful house: where is your deep feeling, the working of your power? do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies:</p>
<p><strong>[63:16]</strong> For you are our father, though Abraham has no knowledge of us, and Israel gives no thought to us: you, O Lord, are our father; from the earliest days you have taken up our cause.</p>
<p><strong>[63:17]</strong> O Lord, why do you send us wandering from your ways, making our hearts hard, so that we have no fear of you? Come back, because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.</p>
<p><strong>[63:18]</strong> Why have evil men gone over your holy place, so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters?</p>
<p><strong>[63:19]</strong> We have become as those who were never ruled by you, on whom your name was not named.</p>
<p><strong>[64:1]</strong> O let the heavens be broken open and come down, so that the mountains may be shaking before you, As when fire puts the brushwood in flames, or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire: to make your name feared by your haters, so that the nations may be shaking before you;</p>
<p><strong>[64:2]</strong> While you do acts of power for which we are not looking, and which have not come to the ears of men in the past.</p>
<p><strong>[64:3]</strong> The ear has not had news of, or the eye seen, &hellip; any God but you, working for the man who is waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>[64:4]</strong> Will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness, even on those who keep in mind your ways? Truly you were angry, and we went on doing evil, and sinning against you in the past.</p>
<p><strong>[64:5]</strong> For we have all become like an unclean person, and all our good acts are like a dirty robe: and we have all become old like a dead leaf, and our sins, like the wind, take us away.</p>
<p><strong>[64:6]</strong> And there is no one who makes prayer to your name, or who is moved to keep true to you: for your face is veiled from us, and you have given us into the power of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>[64:7]</strong> But now, O Lord, you are our father; we are the earth, and you are our maker; and we are all the work of your hand.</p>
<p><strong>[64:8]</strong> Be not very angry, O Lord, and do not keep our sins in mind for ever: give ear to our prayer, for we are all your people.</p>
<p><strong>[64:9]</strong> Your holy towns have become a waste, Zion has become a waste, Jerusalem is a mass of broken walls.</p>
<p><strong>[64:10]</strong> Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers gave praise to you, is burned with fire; and all the things of our desire have come to destruction.</p>
<p><strong>[64:11]</strong> In view of all this, will you still do nothing, O Lord? will you keep quiet, and go on increasing our punishment?</p>
<p><strong>[64:12]</strong> []</p>
<p><strong>[65:1]</strong> I have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me; I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me; I said, Here am I, here am I, to a nation which gave no respect to my name.</p>
<p><strong>[65:2]</strong> All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people, who go in an evil way, after the purposes of their hearts;</p>
<p><strong>[65:3]</strong> A people who make me angry every day, making offerings in gardens, and burning perfumes on bricks.</p>
<p><strong>[65:4]</strong> Who are seated in the resting-places of the dead, and by night are in the secret places; who take pig&rsquo;s flesh for food, and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels.</p>
<p><strong>[65:5]</strong> Who say, Keep away, do not come near me, for fear that I make you holy: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire burning all day.</p>
<p><strong>[65:6]</strong> See, it is recorded before me, says the Lord: I will not keep back my hand, till I have sent punishment,</p>
<p><strong>[65:7]</strong> For their sins and the sins of their fathers, who were burning perfumes on the mountains, and saying evil things against me on the hills: so I will take the measure of their sins, and will send the punishment for them into their breast.</p>
<p><strong>[65:8]</strong> This is the word of the Lord: As the new wine is seen in the grapes, and they say, Do not send destruction on it, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants, in order that I may not put an end to them all.</p>
<p><strong>[65:9]</strong> And I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage: and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves, and my servants will have their resting-place there.</p>
<p><strong>[65:10]</strong> And Sharon will be a grass-land for the flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for the herds: for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me.</p>
<p><strong>[65:11]</strong> But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate;</p>
<p><strong>[65:12]</strong> Your fate will be the sword, and you will all go down to death: because when my voice came to you, you made no answer; you did not give ear to my word; but you did what was evil in my eyes, desiring what was not pleasing to me.</p>
<p><strong>[65:13]</strong> For this cause says the Lord God, My servants will have food, but you will be in need of food: my servants will have drink, but you will be dry: my servants will have joy, but you will be shamed:</p>
<p><strong>[65:14]</strong> My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts, but you will be crying for sorrow, and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit.</p>
<p><strong>[65:15]</strong> And your name will become a curse to my people, and the Lord God will put you to death, and give his servants another name:</p>
<p><strong>[65:16]</strong> So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God, and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God; because the past troubles are gone out of mind, and because they are covered from my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>[65:17]</strong> For see, I am making a new heaven and a new earth: and the past things will be gone completely out of mind.</p>
<p><strong>[65:18]</strong> But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making; for I am making Jerusalem a delight, and her people a joy.</p>
<p><strong>[65:19]</strong> And I will be glad over Jerusalem, and have joy in my people: and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her, or the voice of grief.</p>
<p><strong>[65:20]</strong> No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short, or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure: for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old, and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed.</p>
<p><strong>[65:21]</strong> And they will be building houses and living in them; planting vine-gardens and getting the fruit of them.</p>
<p><strong>[65:22]</strong> They will no longer be building for the use of others, or planting for others to have the fruit: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands.</p>
<p><strong>[65:23]</strong> Their work will not be for nothing, and they will not give birth to children for destruction; for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing, and their offspring will be with them.</p>
<p><strong>[65:24]</strong> And before they make their request I will give an answer, and while they are still making prayer to me, I will give ear.</p>
<p><strong>[65:25]</strong> The wolf and the lamb will take their food together, and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox: but dust will be the snake&rsquo;s food. There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[66:1]</strong> The Lord says, Heaven is the seat of my power, and earth is the resting-place for my feet: what sort of house will you make for me, and what place will be my resting-place?</p>
<p><strong>[66:2]</strong> For all these things my hand has made, and they are mine, says the Lord; but to this man only will I give attention, to him who is poor and broken in spirit, fearing my word.</p>
<p><strong>[66:3]</strong> He who puts an ox to death puts a man to death; he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death; he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pig&rsquo;s blood; he who makes an offering of perfumes for a sign gives worship to an image: as they have gone after their desires, and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things;</p>
<p><strong>[66:4]</strong> So I will go after trouble for them, and will send on them what they are fearing: because no one made answer to my voice, or gave ear to my word; but they did what was evil in my eyes, going after that in which I took no pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>[66:5]</strong> Give ear to the word of the Lord, you who are in fear at his word: your countrymen, hating you, and driving you out because of my name, have said, Let the Lord&rsquo;s glory be made clear, so that we may see your joy; but they will be put to shame.</p>
<p><strong>[66:6]</strong> There is a noise of war from the town, a sound from the Temple, the voice of the Lord giving punishment to his haters.</p>
<p><strong>[66:7]</strong> Before her pains came, she gave birth; before her pains, she gave birth to a man-child.</p>
<p><strong>[66:8]</strong> When has such a story come to men&rsquo;s ears? who has seen such things? will a land come to birth in one day? will a nation be given birth in a minute? For when Zion&rsquo;s pains came on her, she gave birth to her children straight away.</p>
<p><strong>[66:9]</strong> Will I by whom the birth was started, not make it complete? says the Lord. Will I who make children come to birth, let them be kept back? says your God.</p>
<p><strong>[66:10]</strong> Have joy with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you her lovers: take part in her joy, all you who are sorrowing for her:</p>
<p><strong>[66:11]</strong> So that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts, and be delighted with the full measure of her glory.</p>
<p><strong>[66:12]</strong> For the Lord says, See, I will make her peace like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream, and she will take her children in her arms, gently caring for them on her knees.</p>
<p><strong>[66:13]</strong> As to one who is comforted by his mother, so will I give you comfort: and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>[66:14]</strong> And you will see it and your heart will be glad, and your bones will get new strength, like young grass: and the hand of the Lord will be seen at work for his servants, and his wrath against his haters.</p>
<p><strong>[66:15]</strong> For the Lord is coming with fire, and his war-carriages will be like the storm-wind; to give punishment in the heat of his wrath, and his passion is like flames of fire.</p>
<p><strong>[66:16]</strong> For with fire and sword will the Lord come, judging all the earth, and his sword will be on all flesh: and great numbers will be put to death by him.</p>
<p><strong>[66:17]</strong> As for those who keep themselves separate, and make themselves clean in the gardens, going after one in the middle, taking pig&rsquo;s flesh for food, and other disgusting things, such as the mouse: their works and their thoughts will come to an end together, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[66:18]</strong> And I am coming to get together all nations and tongues: and they will come and will see my glory.</p>
<p><strong>[66:19]</strong> And I will put a sign among them, and I will send those who are still living to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, Meshech and Rosh, Tubal and Javan, to the sea-lands far away, who have not had word of me, or seen my glory; and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations.</p>
<p><strong>[66:20]</strong> And they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the Lord, on horses, and in carriages, and in carts, and on asses, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, as the children of Israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[66:21]</strong> And some of them will I take for priests and Levites, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[66:22]</strong> For as the new heaven and the new earth which I will make will be for ever before me, says the Lord, so will your seed and your name be for ever.</p>
<p><strong>[66:23]</strong> And it will be, that from new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh will come to give worship before me, says the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[66:24]</strong> And they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me: for their worm will ever be living, and their fire will never be put out, and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh.</p>
