    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth `them&rsquo; out of the church.</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Demetrius hath the witness of all `men&rsquo;, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write `them&rsquo; to thee with ink and pen:</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace `be&rsquo; unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</p>
