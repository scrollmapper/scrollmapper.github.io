    <p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> That good thing which was committed unto `thee&rsquo; guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> Suffer hardship with `me&rsquo;, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of `this&rsquo; life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> Therefore I endure all things for the elect&rsquo;s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging `them&rsquo; in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master&rsquo;s use, prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p><strong>[2:23]</strong> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</p>
<p><strong>[2:24]</strong> And the Lord&rsquo;s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</p>
<p><strong>[2:25]</strong> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p><strong>[2:26]</strong> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> Every scripture inspired of God `is&rsquo; also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> I charge `thee&rsquo; in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom `be&rsquo; the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</p>
