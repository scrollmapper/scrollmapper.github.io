<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> for the truth&rsquo;s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I rejoice greatly that I have found `certain&rsquo; of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, `even&rsquo; they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into `your&rsquo; house, and give him no greeting:</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Having many things to write unto you, I would not `write them&rsquo; with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> The children of thine elect sister salute thee.</p>
