<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things `which happened&rsquo; unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> the one `do it&rsquo; of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but <code>that' with all boldness, as always, </code>so&rsquo; now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> But if to live in the flesh, &ndash;`if&rsquo; this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;</p>
<p><strong>[1:26]</strong> that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</p>
<p><strong>[1:27]</strong> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</p>
<p><strong>[1:28]</strong> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;</p>
<p><strong>[1:29]</strong> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</p>
<p><strong>[1:30]</strong> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> `doing&rsquo; nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient `even&rsquo; unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <code>things' in heaven and </code>things&rsquo; on earth and `things&rsquo; under the earth,</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> Do all things without murmurings and questionings:</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,</p>
<p><strong>[2:16]</strong> holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.</p>
<p><strong>[2:17]</strong> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:</p>
<p><strong>[2:18]</strong> and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
<p><strong>[2:19]</strong> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>
<p><strong>[2:20]</strong> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.</p>
<p><strong>[2:21]</strong> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[2:22]</strong> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child <code>serveth' a father, </code>so&rsquo; he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>[2:23]</strong> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:</p>
<p><strong>[2:24]</strong> but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.</p>
<p><strong>[2:25]</strong> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</p>
<p><strong>[2:26]</strong> since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:</p>
<p><strong>[2:27]</strong> for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>[2:28]</strong> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
<p><strong>[2:29]</strong> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</p>
<p><strong>[2:30]</strong> because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, `even&rsquo; that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> Brethren, I could not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing `I do&rsquo;, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:</p>
<p><strong>[3:16]</strong> only, whereunto we have attained, by that same `rule&rsquo; let us walk.</p>
<p><strong>[3:17]</strong> Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.</p>
<p><strong>[3:18]</strong> For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, `that they are&rsquo; the enemies of the cross of Christ:</p>
<p><strong>[3:19]</strong> whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and `whose&rsquo; glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.</p>
<p><strong>[3:20]</strong> For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p><strong>[3:21]</strong> who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, `that it may be&rsquo; conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.</p>
<p><strong>[4:1]</strong> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</p>
<p><strong>[4:2]</strong> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[4:3]</strong> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p><strong>[4:4]</strong> Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</p>
<p><strong>[4:5]</strong> Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</p>
<p><strong>[4:6]</strong> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p>
<p><strong>[4:7]</strong> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:8]</strong> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
<p><strong>[4:9]</strong> The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p><strong>[4:10]</strong> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>[4:11]</strong> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</p>
<p><strong>[4:12]</strong> I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</p>
<p><strong>[4:13]</strong> I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</p>
<p><strong>[4:14]</strong> Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</p>
<p><strong>[4:15]</strong> And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;</p>
<p><strong>[4:16]</strong> for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</p>
<p><strong>[4:17]</strong> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</p>
<p><strong>[4:18]</strong> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things `that came&rsquo; from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>[4:19]</strong> And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[4:20]</strong> Now unto our God and Father `be&rsquo; the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>[4:21]</strong> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.</p>
<p><strong>[4:22]</strong> All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p><strong>[4:23]</strong> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
