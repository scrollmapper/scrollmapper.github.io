<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> yet for love&rsquo;s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> For perhaps he was therefore parted `from thee&rsquo; for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>[1:17]</strong> If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p><strong>[1:18]</strong> But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth `thee&rsquo; aught, put that to mine account;</p>
<p><strong>[1:19]</strong> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p><strong>[1:20]</strong> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]</strong> Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</p>
<p><strong>[1:22]</strong> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</p>
<p><strong>[1:23]</strong> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</p>
<p><strong>[1:24]</strong> `and so do&rsquo; Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</p>
<p><strong>[1:25]</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
