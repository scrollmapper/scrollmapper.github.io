<p><strong>[1:1]</strong> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&rsquo;s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p>
<p><strong>[1:2]</strong> in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</p>
<p><strong>[1:3]</strong> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p><strong>[1:4]</strong> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
<p><strong>[1:5]</strong> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;</p>
<p><strong>[1:6]</strong> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p><strong>[1:7]</strong> For the bishop must be blameless, as God&rsquo;s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p><strong>[1:8]</strong> but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;</p>
<p><strong>[1:9]</strong> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.</p>
<p><strong>[1:10]</strong> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</p>
<p><strong>[1:11]</strong> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><strong>[1:12]</strong> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</p>
<p><strong>[1:13]</strong> This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p><strong>[1:14]</strong> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p>
<p><strong>[1:15]</strong> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p><strong>[1:16]</strong> They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
<p><strong>[2:1]</strong> But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:</p>
<p><strong>[2:2]</strong> that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:</p>
<p><strong>[2:3]</strong> that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</p>
<p><strong>[2:4]</strong> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p><strong>[2:5]</strong> `to be&rsquo; sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:</p>
<p><strong>[2:6]</strong> the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:</p>
<p><strong>[2:7]</strong> in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine `showing&rsquo; uncorruptness, gravity,</p>
<p><strong>[2:8]</strong> sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.</p>
<p><strong>[2:9]</strong> <code>Exhort' servants to be in subjection to their own masters, </code>and&rsquo; to be well-pleasing `to them&rsquo; in all things; not gainsaying;</p>
<p><strong>[2:10]</strong> not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p><strong>[2:11]</strong> For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p>
<p><strong>[2:12]</strong> instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;</p>
<p><strong>[2:13]</strong> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p><strong>[2:14]</strong> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.</p>
<p><strong>[2:15]</strong> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
<p><strong>[3:1]</strong> Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</p>
<p><strong>[3:2]</strong> to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.</p>
<p><strong>[3:3]</strong> For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</p>
<p><strong>[3:4]</strong> But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</p>
<p><strong>[3:5]</strong> not by works `done&rsquo; in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p><strong>[3:6]</strong> which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p><strong>[3:7]</strong> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>[3:8]</strong> Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:</p>
<p><strong>[3:9]</strong> but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]</strong> A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;</p>
<p><strong>[3:11]</strong> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</p>
<p><strong>[3:12]</strong> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.</p>
<p><strong>[3:13]</strong> Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p><strong>[3:14]</strong> And let our `people&rsquo; also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p><strong>[3:15]</strong> All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.</p>
